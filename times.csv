Ex-Wescom chief says he made no secret deal

"," THE former commander of the Western Command (,), Vice Adm. Alberto Carlos, told the Senate Wednesday that he did not make any secret deals with China on a ""new model"" to manage resupply missions to Filipino troops on Ayungin (Second Thomas) Shoal.,Testifying before the Senate Committee on National Defense and Security, Carlos — who is at the center of a wiretapping scandal — admitted receiving a phone call in early January from a Chinese military attaché whom he identified as ""senior Col. Li."",But he said that the supposed agreement on a ""new model"" to handle the Ayungin situation was never part of their conversation, which lasted only about three to five minutes.,Carlos, who was relieved as Wescom chief only recently, said Li had initiated the call and that he did not allow anyone to record their conversation.,Carlos declined to discuss the matter publicly and said he would reveal this in a closed-door meeting or an executive session.,Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian, who was invited to the hearing, was a no-show. The Chinese Embassy did not reply to media queries on why it did not send any representative to the wiretapping inquiry.,The embassy on May 7 released the supposed transcript of the taped conversation between Carlos and Li, which showed that the former Wescom head agreed to the said new model to address the sea row.,Carlos said he tried to execute the President's orders to reduce the tension in his area of operation. ""There are stories about me making secret deals with China and their officials. These are completely false,"" he said.,""I did not enter into any secret deals that will compromise the interests of our country. I have not compromised the country's territorial integrity. I have not given up our sovereign rights and entitlements,"" Carlos said.,""I am a soldier for the Filipino [people]. And I remain a loyal servant of the republic. I am not authorized to enter into agreements, and I will never pretend to be my country's authority on matters regarding policy or country-to-country agreements. That should have been obvious to China officials as it is obvious to everyone else,"" he said.,""Let me repeat. I did not forge any agreement at the level and magnitude that would bind our two countries for the long term and redefine foreign policy,"" Carlos said.,The official said at that time when the supposed wiretapping took place, he was only the commander of the Western Command and not even of the entire West Philippine Sea. ""As Wescom commander, I have done my very best to provide for the welfare of Wescom personnel,"" he said.,""We are on the same team. Let us be united against this false narrative. Our frontliners stationed at BRP Sierra Madre and the whole Western Command team together with the Philippine Coast Guard and all the government agencies involved in RoRe (rotation and resupply) missions need all the support we can give them. Let us continue to stand by them to give them strength,"" Carlos said.,The officer denied that he knew that his telephone conversation with Li was being recorded. Carlos said he got a message from the same Chinese military attaché two days ago but ignored it.,""He sent me a message two days ago, Sir, but I did not acknowledge [it],"" Carlos said.,Carlos said he was willing to reveal the gist of their phone conversation and text the message in an executive session. Asked if he thinks Li was the source of the leakage, Carlos said it would be a ""reasonable assumption."",Estrada vowed to file appropriate remedial measures stemming from what he noted was the apparent manipulation of a wiretapped phone conversation between Carlos and Li.,""This wiretapping incident is very worrisome; that's why we need to do something about it,"" Estrada said in Filipino.,""And it is more worrisome that these Chinese officials can easily manipulate a conversation [with our officials] to cause confusion and put suspicion on a bemedalled officer like Vice Admiral Carlos who serves the nation honestly,"" Estrada said.,Despite the flap over wiretapping, Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo said the situation has not yet reached the point where the Philippines has to downgrade its diplomatic relations.,Manalo also challenged China to present documents proving its claim that the Philippines indeed forged agreements with Beijing to manage the sea row.,The Philippines in recent months have filed a diplomatic protest against China's harassment, specifically the use of water cannons on Philippine vessels on regular resupply missions to Filipino troops stationed at the beached BRP Sierra Madre in Ayungin Shoal and fishermen in the Bajo de Masinloc or Scarborough Shoal.,Some senators have criticized China for illegally recording the conversation between Carlos and Li.,""I don't think we're there yet,"" Manalo said in a briefing on Wednesday. ""I think that the whole idea is we've always said that we should try and manage our relationship, manage our disputes through diplomatic means and through peaceful means,"" Manalo said.,""We're going to continue talking with China. I think that's our job at the DFA (Department of Foreign Affairs). We have to have an understanding of how we can manage our relationship without increasing tensions,"" he said.,""But definitely, in many ways, China is not really helping us to do so. That's the challenge because of the many incidents that are occurring. So, that's a challenge for us. But we are still definitely committed to seeking diplomatic means to manage our tensions,"" the DFA chief said.,Manalo also said China should present documents to prove its claim that concerned Philippine officials have entered into an agreement with Beijing on how to avoid conflict in the South China Sea or West Philippine Sea.,China accused the Philippines of ""reneging"" on its promise years ago to remove the BRP Sierra Madre from Ayungin Shoal. The Marcos administration said it was not aware of such an agreement and would rescind it if it came to light.,""Let me just say, I've never seen those agreements. They are not in writing. I think the only source of those agreements has been from China. That's the truth. We've never seen any of those agreements. I don't recall even having discussed any of those agreements,"" Manalo said.,""If they can show us a document that was signed or at least some document then maybe they would have a case,"" Manalo said.,Also on Wednesday, the military said it would not be deterred from protecting Filipino fishermen in Bajo de Masinloc amid a threat for China to have them arrested.,In a press briefing, Rear Adm. Roy Vincent Trinidad, spokesman for the West Philippine Sea, said the AFP is duty-bound to ensure the integrity of the national territory, including protecting Filipinos and sovereignty.,""The guidance is really to continue our mandate of ensuring the integrity of the national territory, protecting Filipinos and securing our sovereignty,"" Trinidad said.,A day after the civilian Atin Ito made a successful caravan to Bajo de Masinloc or Panatag Shoal, China issued a pronouncement threatening to arrest Filipino fishermen should they enter the area that China declared as part of its sovereign waters.,However, the government blasted China's policy saying it has no authority over Bajo de Masinloc since it remained within the Philippines' 200-mile exclusive economic zone.",https://www.manilatimes.net/2024/05/23/news/ex-wescom-chief-says-he-made-no-secret-deal/1947848

Philippines blames China for loss of giant clams in disputed shoal and urges environmental inquiry
","
By Associated Press
","
May 23, 2024
","MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines blamed Chinese fishermen on Monday for a massive loss of giant clams in a disputed shoal controlled by China's coast guard in the South China Sea and urged an international inquiry into the amount of environmental damage in the area.,The Philippine coast guard presented surveillance photographs of Chinese fishermen harvesting large numbers of giant clams for a number of years in a lagoon at Scarborough Shoal, but said signs of such activities stopped in March 2019.,Parts of the surrounding coral appeared to be badly scarred, in what the coast guard said was apparently a futile search by the Chinese for more clams. The lagoon is a prominent fishing area which Filipinos call Bajo de Masinloc and the Chinese calll Huangyan Dao off the northwestern Philippines.,""Those were the last remaining giant clams that we saw in Bajo de Masinloc,"" Philippine coast guard spokesperson Commodore Jay Tarriela said at a news conference.,""We are alarmed and worried about the situation that's happening there,"" National Security Council Assistant Director General Jonathan Malaya said. He said China should allow an independent inquiry by experts from the United Nations and environmental groups.,The Chinese Embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Beijing has repeatedly asserted its sovereignty over much of the busy South China Sea. The territorial disputes involve China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. The Indonesian navy has also been involved in skirmishes with the Chinese coast guard and fishing vessels in the Natuna waters in the margins of the South China Sea.,The Philippines has adopted a policy of publicizing China's increasingly assertive actions in the contested waters to gain international support, and the news conference was its latest effort to condemn China's stewardship of Scarborough Shoal.,China effectively seized the shoal in 2012 after a standoff that ended when Philippine government ships withdrew based on what Manila said was a deal brokered by American officials to ease the dangerous confrontation. China reneged on its promise to remove its ships and has since surrounded the shoal with coast guard and suspected militia ships, according to Philippine officials.,Since then, the Chinese coast guard has had a series of skirmishes with Philippine patrol ships and fishing boats, which have been prevented from entering the lagoon, ringed by mostly submerged coral outcrops. Three weeks ago, Chinese ships fired powerful water cannons that damaged Philippine coast guard and fisheries vessels.,""They're preventing us from getting into the lagoon,"" Malaya said. ""We can ask third-party environmental groups or even the United Nations to do a fact-finding mission to determine the environmental situation."",The Philippines has brought its territorial disputes with China to international arbitration and largely won. The 2016 ruling invalidated China's expansive claims to much of the South China Sea, a key global trade route, on historical grounds and cited Chinese government actions that resulted in environmental damage in the offshore region.,China refused to participate in the arbitration, rejected its ruling and continues to defy it.,The territorial hostilities have sparked fears of a larger conflict that could involve the U.S., which has warned that it's obligated to defend the Philippines, its long-time treaty ally, if Filipino forces, ships and aircraft come under an armed attack, including in the South China Sea.",https://www.manilatimes.net/2024/05/23/news/national/philippines-blames-china-for-loss-of-giant-clams-in-disputed-shoal-and-urges-environmental-inquiry/1948038

","INVESTIGATORS are trying to determine the role of a Canadian man in the biggest drug seizure in the country's history that took place last month in Batangas.,Government prosecutors on Wednesday recommended the filing of charges against Thomas Gordon O'Quinn for possession of illegal drugs and use of fictitious names, the Department of Justice said.,O'Quinn was arrested in a spa in Tagaytay on May 16 under a mission order issued by the Bureau of Immigration, stemming from an Interpol Red Notice on him.,Seized from the Canadian during the operation were illicit drugs as well as several identification cards under different names with the same facial photographs.,According to Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla, considering that O'Quinn was implicated in the Alitagtag drug haul, this will be the subject of further case buildup and preliminary investigation to determine his particular participation and the involvement of others.,The case stemmed from the investigation conducted by the Philippine National Police-National Capital Region Police Office Regional Intelligence Division to identify the possible cohorts of Michael Zarate Ajalon, the driver of the van that was flagged down at a checkpoint in Barangay Pinagkurusan, Alitagtag, Batangas.,At least 1.4 tons of shabu, with an estimated street value of P9.68 billion, were found inside the van driven by Ajalon.,According to authorities, O'Quinn possibly played a big role in the delivery of the seized drugs in Alitagtag.,Reports claim that O'Quinn and the arrested driver were connected.,""We want no part of international fugitives; you may have evaded the laws of your country but not ours,"" Secretary Remulla said.,

Old school calendar returns in SY2025-26

","
May 23, 2024
","PRESIDENT Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has ordered the country's gradual return to the old June-to-March academic calendar by school year 2025-2026.,As part of the transition, school year 2024-2025 would begin on July 29 this year and end on April 15, 2025, Presidential Communications Secretary Cheloy Garafil said Wednesday.,The President met with Vice President Sara Duterte, who heads the Department of Education (DepEd), to discuss the two options for SY 2024-2025.,The first option comprised 180 school days with 15 in-person Saturday classes, while the second option was to have 165 school days with no in-person Saturday classes. Both options would end the SY on March 31, 2025.,However, the President said the 165-day school calendar was too short as this would significantly reduce the number of school days and contact time, which may compromise learning outcomes.,He also did not want students to go to school on Saturdays to complete the 180-day school calendar because it would jeopardize their well-being and demand more resources.,As a compromise, Marcos said instead of ending on March 31, 2025, DepEd should adjust the SY to end on April 15, 2025, to enable students to complete 180 days without using Saturdays to go to school.,""Let's make the school days longer. Let's just add the school days instead of including Saturdays,"" Marcos told Duterte during the meeting.,Duterte said they had already consulted with teachers, school officials and parents as far as the proposed school calendar was concerned.,The decision to revert to the old school calendar was prompted by the extreme heat amid the El Niño phenomenon, causing schools to suspend classes several times since April this year.,The Philippines used to start the school year for public schools in June but postponed it to August starting in 2022 amid a coronavirus pandemic and to prevent heavy rains and typhoons from disrupting classes.,For the current school year — 2023-2024 — the DepEd set the end of the academic year earlier than scheduled — on May 31, 2024.,Education Undersecretary Michael Wesley Poa said the competencies of students will not be affected by the reduction in school days in the upcoming school year, noting that the department will guide teachers to ensure that every learning day will count.,""We are going to give proper guidance to teachers so we can be effective even if our school year will have fewer days. That is why it is important that we extend this to April 15,"" Poa said.,Poa said that DepEd will issue a department order on the new school calendar once it is finalized.,ACT Teachers Rep. France Castro lauded the move of Malacañang to set the school year from July 29 to April 15, 2025.,""This is a positive step towards addressing the concerns of our teachers, students and parents who have long been advocating a more humane and conducive learning environment,"" Castro said.",https://www.manilatimes.net/2024/05/23/news/national/old-school-calendar-returns-in-sy2025-26/1947845

Senators question 'love child' explanation

May 23, 2024
","SENATORS on Wednesday expressed exasperation over the repetitive answers provided by Bamban Mayor Alice Guo, whose identity has come under question because she could not provide basic details about her childhood.,As the Senate Committee on Women, Children, Family Relations and Gender Equality resumed its inquiry into Guo's identity and her possible links to illegal online gambling operations in her town, Sen. Raffy Tulfo asked the mayor if she was willing to take a lie detector test to address her conflicting statements.,Tulfo and other senators seemed skeptical about Guo's claim that she was raised and hidden away on a farm because she was the love child of her father and a domestic, who left when she was young.,""Are you willing to undergo a lie detector test? Everything you say will be examined, especially about your being a love child... If you are telling the truth, it will help you, so people will know you are telling it. On the other hand, if the senators find out that you are lying, you can be held in contempt by the committee and even imprisoned,"" Tulfo said.,Guo said she would take a lie detector test.,
,Tulfo also said records showing her parents got married contradict her claim that she was a love child.,The senator seemed to become annoyed after Guo repeatedly claimed that she had never discussed this with her Chinese father, who supposedly cared for her after her mom abandoned her.,Tulfo said he was not buying Guo's excuse, saying it is a natural human reaction to inquire about your family history, especially if you are running for public office.,""You keep repeating in this hearing that your mother is a housemaid. You're portraying yourself as someone who came from humble beginnings. But she is married to your father. There are many holes in your statements,"" the senator said in Filipino.,He also accused her of trying to gain public sympathy with her story about being a love child.,Sen. Loren Legarda said she was not convinced that Guo, 38, is Filipino since the mayor had some difficulties narrating the first nine years of her life on the farm where she supposedly grew up.,""If you're really Chinese and fronting for other people, go back to your country. But if you are a Filipino and you were born here, convince us. So, I'm trying to help you by trying to make you recall your childhood,"" Legarda told Guo.,The senator said she would not accept Guo's explanation about her early years on the farm, which appeared to be ""scripted."" Guo replied, ""Your honor, I grew up in Bamban, Tarlac. I grew up on a farm."",Legarda was visibly upset by Guo's apparent repetitive and evasive answer. ""When I ask you the same question, it's the same rote [response]. So, convince us. Who were your childhood playmates? At nine years, you would have some recollection."",Guo said, ""Madam senator, I grew up in Barangay Virgen delos Remedios [in] Bamban, Tarlac. I am a Filipino. I grew up together with our farm workers. [It was] 38 years ago, madam senator. I really can't remember anything [about my childhood life]."",""Could you kindly give us the earliest photos of yourself and your family and your playmates in your very exclusive farm ... and your relatives in China and your father's relatives and proof of your homeschooling?"" Legarda said. Guo said she would comply with the senator's request.,Legarda said, ""What are we trying to point out here? Our government agencies should not allow criminal syndicates to produce fake documents [to foreigners] that would allow them to secure legitimate Philippine identification like passports."",""It will break my heart if we have a foreigner who is an elected official. It's really a national security risk,"" Legarda said.,Legarda urged Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) officials at the hearing to crack down on a possible syndicate inside the agency that gives birth certificates to foreign nationals so they can obtain an authentic Philippine passport.,She raised the issue of fraudulent acquisition of birth certificates by foreign nationals. ""Have you conducted an investigation in the PSA on people who may have been involved in the syndicate that provides fake birth certificates? Have you discovered anything or not yet?"" Legarda asked PSA officials.,""There were 308 fake birth certificates that you said were issued that were used for Philippine passports in 2023. So, I would assume that the DFA had canceled their passports. And I would assume that you had filed cases or even invalidated the fake birth certificates,"" Legarda said.,In response, Eliezer Ambatali of the PSA legal service said the agency had already conducted an investigation and filed the corresponding administrative cases.,Meanwhile, Sen. Risa Hontiveros, who heads the panel, said that the hearing was not about race but about pursuing the truth.,""Let me also take this opportunity to remind all of us: racism is never justified. The Philippines must remain open and dependable to people who follow our law and have no ill intentions, whether Filipinos or foreigners,"" Hontiveros said.,""But if they are admitting fugitives, if they conspire with money launderers, if they try to run for public office knowing that they [are not qualified] ... if they are working against our national security, we as elected officials will become a failure as public servants if we will not investigate it,"" she said.",https://www.manilatimes.net/2024/05/23/news/national/senators-question-love-child-explanation/1947983

'No border tightening' amid new Covid threat
",,"
May 23, 2024
"," THE Department of Health (DoH) on Wednesday said it would not recommend border restrictions amid the resurgence of Covid-19 infections in neighboring Singapore.,""I'm not thinking of border control, mandatory mask... I'm not thinking that, but I'm advising every Filipino to observe minimum public health standards,'' Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa said during a briefing in Malacañang.,''No requirement for border control, no requirement for mandatory masks, no requirement for additional vaccination. But we're monitoring these cases,'' he added.,The new Covid variants, known as FLiRT, triggered the surge in cases in Singapore that surpassed the 25,000 mark for the period of May 5 to 11.,Currently, KP.1 and KP.2 make up over two-thirds of the cases in the city-state.,The resurgence of the disease has resulted in high demand for at-home testing kits among Singaporeans.,Herbosa advised the public to get tested for Covid-19 when their respiratory distress last longer than five days, adding the number of Covid-19 infections in the country was still very low.,""We are asking our doctors and hospitals to report antigen testing. For now, the testing is not PCR (polymerase chain reaction); it's rapid antigen. So, we are asking our doctors to report that or even our Epidemiology Bureau,"" he said.,Herbosa added that while it's possible for the new variant to reach the country, it is not as dangerous as many people think.,""That's why it's classified as [a] variant under monitoring. The one we are monitoring really is ILA or influenza-like illnesses, of which Covid-19 is one of those, right? So, we monitor that. Luckily, even the one in Singapore is mostly respiratory tract infection — cough, common colds... If you are sick, you have a cough, cold, sore throat, better to stay home. If you need to go out, wear a mask,"" he said.,Herbosa reminded President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who has battled Covid-19 three times in the past, to be extra cautious against the disease.,Marcos was due to deliver the keynote address at the opening of the 21st edition of the IISS Shangri-La Dialogue, regarded as Asia's premier defense summit, on May 31.,""I'm sure his security would take into consideration the atmosphere or the situation. That's one of the security risks, so they'll take care of that and make sure the President is protected,"" Herbosa said.,Marcos on Wednesday tasked the Health Department to address the shortage of healthcare workers in the Philippines.,""We will need the human resources, so we saw the gap. I presented to the President that we need to have about 190,000 to actually fill the gaps in our health care system.
