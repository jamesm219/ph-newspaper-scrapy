The Vatican is cracking down on miracles. Here are the new rules for ‘supernatural’ occurrences,Philip C. Almond,"May 23, 2024 | 11:23 am","Disclaimer:This asset – including all text, audio and imagery – is provided by The Conversation. Reuters Connect has not verified or endorsed the material, which is being made available to professional media customers to facilitate the free flow of global news and information. SOURCE:THE CONVERSATION  byPhilip C. Almond,Emeritus Professor in the History of Religious Thought,The University of Queensland New norms for differentiating supernatural phenomena from the natural within Roman Catholicism took effect on May 19. The new norms arise from the need to evaluate as quickly as possible the supernatural origin or otherwise of an array of phenomena occurring increasingly within the Catholic world and spreading quickly via social media. Possible supernatural phenomena include apparitions – especially of Jesus or the Virgin Mary – interior or exterior voices, writings or messages from the beyond, the weeping or bleeding of sacred images, the bleeding of consecrated eucharistic hosts, and so on. Visions of the Virgin Mary, in particular, continue to occur regularly within Catholic Christendom. The new document neither endorses supernatural phenomena nor rejects them. Rather, it provides a set of criteria and processes by means of which the church can officially discriminate between them and separate the authentic from the fake. So what do we need to know about these norms? The new norms replace an earlier document from 1978. In this 1978 document, the decision whether to approve a phenomenon as supernatural or not was essentially left in the hands of a local authority – in most cases, a diocesan bishop. According to criteria, the bishop decided on a choice of two options: supernatural, or not. In the case of a judgment that a phenomenon was of supernatural origin, he could permit a public manifestation of devotion to the supernatural phenomenon equivalent to his saying, “for now, nothing stands in the way” (“pro nunc nihil obstat”). Under this document, central control of the Vatican was minimal. Local authorities were in control. The new document is intended to more effectively oversee the validation of such events. It does so by centralizing authorization, management and control of the supernatural within the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, better known as “the Inquisition”. Any decision bishops or any other authority wish to make has to be submitted to the Dicastery for approval. The new document declares the Holy Spirit may: reach our hearts through certain supernatural occurrences such as apparitions or visions of Christ or the Blessed Virgin. But the central authority of the church will now decide where, when and how God works, his wonders or miracles to perform. Overall, God will be shown to be minimally directly intervening in the world. Rather than a relatively simple judgment whether an event is supernatural or not, the church now provides six possible ways an event can be classified. These range from “nihil obstat” (“nothing stands in the way”) to “declaratio de non supernaturalitate” (“declaration of non-supernaturality”). But even where a nihil obstat is granted, as a rule, neither a diocesan bishop, nor any conference of bishops, nor the Dicastery itself “will declare that these phenomena are of supernatural origin”. In short, a clear declaration of a supernatural event having taken place will virtually never happen (or, at least, unless the Pope intervenes). A declaration of non-supernaturality will be made if it is discovered the phenomenon was based on fabrication, on an erroneous intention, or on mythomania. In short, if a fake or a hoax is discovered. Between these two extremes lie four other possible judgments. Although there are positive signs of divine action in each of these, they each indicate increasing worries about credibility. The first two of these concern increasing doubts about the credibility of the phenomenon. The next two concern increasing doubts about the honesty of the people involved. If a diocesan bishop, after consultation, believes a supernatural phenomenon requires investigation, he alerts the Dicastery. He then convenes an Investigatory Commission to carry out a “trial”. This trial will see witness examinations, sworn depositions, expert analysis of written texts, along with technical-scientific, doctrinal and canonical assessments. It is pretty much the traditional method of the Inquisition in modern dress (or vestments). The commission finally makes a judgment on the truth of the matter based on positive and negative criteria. Positive criteria include the reputation of persons involved, doctrinal orthodoxy, exclusion of fakery and the fruits of Christian life that have resulted from it. Negative criteria include the possibility of manifest error, potential doctrinal errors, breeding of division within the church, an overt pursuit of profit, power, fame or social recognition, and the personal and public ethical rectitude of those involved, along with their mental health. In the light of the commission’s work, the bishop proposes to the Dicastery a judgment following one of the six ways of classification. The Dicastery then makes a final judgment to be delivered to the bishop, who is obliged to implement the decision and make it public There is deep concern within the Vatican over misinformation and disinformation about the supernatural. The document informs us: Now more than ever, these phenomena involve many people […] and spread rapidly across different regions and many countries. The digital world is a place of multiple meanings where the supernatural occupies a space somewhere between reality and unreality. It is a domain where belief is a matter of choice and disbelief is willingly and happily suspended. Ironically, the outcome of the new norms will be to minimize the number of phenomena recognized as “supernatural” within the Catholic Church. In effect, it will put stricter limits on God’s action within the world. The new norms within the church to manage the supernatural are intended more to “disenchant” the world than further to “enchant” it.",https://www.bworldonline.com/opinion/2024/05/23/596964/the-vatican-is-cracking-down-on-miracles-here-are-the-new-rules-for-supernatural-occurrences/
"Acquisitions, synergy, and technology headline Aboitiz Group’s Great Transformation",,"May 23, 2024 | 9:30 am","The Aboitiz Group reinforced its transformation goals for 2024 and beyond as it put its partnerships, acquisitions, andinterbusinessopportunities front and center during its 8th annual Leaders Conference (LeadCon) held this month. Over 500 Aboitiz leaders gathered for the conference at Solaire Grand Ballroom, where the Group not only unveiled its growth strategies,but also presented itscutting edgeinnovations including its first pair of AI-powered virtual team members. With theLeadCon’stheme ‘UnlockingTechglomeratePotential’,the Group took stock of the steps that have been taken in recent yearsin order totransform itself into the Philippines’ firsttechglomerate. As the Groupexperiencedmassive growth in recent years, it is poised to form a sustainable business ecosystem among its many diverse companies that will become the core of its strategy in the coming years. The Aboitiz Group is in the third year of its Great Transformation initiative, with everything from its culture, to processes, to technology evolving at a rapid pace. Aboitiz Group President and CEO Sabin M. Aboitiz emphasized the need for team leaders to imbibe the value of transformation and be the examples for their team members. “Our people will never change unless our leaders do, and our leaders will never change unless they know why they’re doing it and why it’s important. It’s our responsibility as leaders to make sure everyone is supported. When we genuinely care about our teams, we create a leadership that inspires more than motivates,” Sabin Aboitiz said. Sabin Aboitiz added that the LeadCon is an avenue for the Group’s team leaders to learn the key factors to unlocking techglomerate potential for their teams — namely strategy, synergy, and transformation — directly from Aboitiz’s top brass. Each key speaker in the event offered a view of the Aboitiz Group’s transformation journey and the opportunities that lie ahead. Chris Beshouri, Aboitiz Equity Ventures’ (AEV) Chief Strategy Officer, presented how the Aboitiz Group has rapidly transformed in the last decade after divesting its shipping and transport business. In such a short timespan, the Group has expanded to become a major conglomerate, diversifying its business interests with big-ticket acquisitions such as Citibank’s Philippine consumer banking business, the operation and management of the Mactan-Cebu International Airport, and a 40% stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Philippines, Inc., among others. The Group has also entered into major partnerships. One is with Japan’s largest power generation company JERA, and a separate partnership with Meralco PowerGen and San Miguel Global Power Holdings for the country’s first and most expansive integrated LNG facility in a deal worth $3.3 billion. In just three and a half years, the Aboitiz Group had entered into P255 billion worth of deals. According to Beshouri, this is the clearest sign yet of the Group’s transformation. “The goal of transformation is to have impact. And the potential for this Group to have economic impact is enormous. If you add up the market value of the (Aboitiz) Group, we represent an estimated 4%-5% of the total PH stock market capitalization as of 2023,” Beshouri said. Meanwhile, Eduardo Aboitiz, AEV Chief Synergy Officer, discussed the important role synergies will play in the pursuit of the Group’s goals. Eduardo contextualized synergies as activities wherein Aboitiz businesses work together, enhancing value creation and making the whole Group to be more than the sum of its parts. He shared that the Group is not starting from scratch. The Aboitiz story began with abaca production. From abaca, the Group started producing rope and mainly selling this to the shipping industry — which eventually became the Group’s flagship business for over 80 years. Today, the Aboitiz ecosystem is wider, resulting in more synergy opportunities. A straightforward example is AboitizPower (AP) reliably providing 100MW of competitively-priced power to its sister companies such as Republic Cement, Pilmico, UnionBank, Aboitiz Infracapital, and Coca-Cola. The Group also leverages on synergies to strengthen its Economic Estates. The Group combines its various assets such as power, water, construction, and banking to create a stronger offer to estate locators, enhancing value for all parties involved. There are other initiatives being pursued. Still, despite these, Eduardo emphasized that massive opportunities remained untapped. He challenged everyone to maximize synergies and integrate the thinking in every team member of the Group. “Synergies do not start and end with the people in this room. Everyone can contribute. As we embark on this journey, we will start to see more connections appear. When we maximize these connections, that’s when we can become a fully-integrated ecosystem and be fully transformed,” he said. The Group’s businesses are not the only ones called to transform, but the individual team leaders as well. AEV Head of Transformation Dea Franko-Csuba called on the leaders to be adaptive and open to technologies, processes, and behaviors that can improve themselves, their teams, and the business. She cited the need to embrace emerging technologies that will assist teams in automating and optimizing work processes, such as artificial intelligence (AI). “The Transformed Aboitiz Group is not an end destination. The future of our industries is unfolding in front of our eyes and we have to constantly reimagine ourselves on the fly. To build an adaptive, intelligent organization, we need to change the way from command and control leadership to an agile, empowering leadership style, where the leaders define where we are and where we are heading but the team figures out how to get there as a collaborative effort,” Franko-Csuba said. As a highlight of her discussion, she introduced the Aboitiz Group’s first-ever virtual team members, Elsie and Albert. The AI avatars were presented onstage, and gave helpful summaries of the presentations throughout the conference. They were also available to answer queries outside the event entrance, showcasing the ability of AI to assist the leaders and their teams. The LeadCon also welcomed guest speaker Michael J.T. Steep, Founder of the Stanford University Disruptive Technology Program, who cited the need for innovation to facilitate transformation. He advocated for the use of AI in order to assist in the growth of businesses, and encouraged leaders to not only focus on being efficient workers, but also to foster people and networking skills to find the experts that their businesses need. The Aboitiz Group’s Leaders Conference gathers team leaders from across the Group’s various business units in order to set direction and strategy as well as share best practices and achievements within the Group. This year’s conference makes a return to a grand in-person event after several years of being held virtually or on a hybrid basis.

‘Boiling not warming’: Marine life suffers as Thai sea temperatures hit record,Reuters,"May 23, 2024 | 11:31 am","TRAT, Thailand–Aquatic life from coral reefs to fish in the Thailand’s eastern gulf coast is suffering as sea surface temperatures hit record highs this month amid aregional heatwave, worrying scientists and local communities. The once vibrant and colorful corals, about five meters(16 feet)underwater, have turned white in a phenomenon known as coral bleaching, a sign that their health was deteriorating, due to higher water temperatures, scientists say. Sea surface temperatures in the Eastern Gulf of Thailand reached 32.73°C (90.91°F) earlier this month while underwater readings are slightly warmer, with dive computers showing around 33°C, data shows. “I couldn’t find a single healthy coral,” said marine biologist Lalita Putchim of the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources (DMCR) after completing a dive in the gulf coast. “Almost all of the species have bleached, there’s very little that’s not affected.” The Trat archipelago is home to over 66 islands, with over 28.4 square kilometers (2,841 hectares) of coral reef, where Lalita has found that up to 30% of coral life was bleaching and 5% had already died. If water temperatures do not cool, more coral will die, Lalita said. “It’s global boiling, not just global warming,” she said. Rising temperatures were also impacting other marine life and the livelihoods of local fishermen including Sommay Singsura. In recent years, his daily catch of seafood has been dwindling. Previously he had been able to make up to 10,000 baht ($275) a day, but now sometimes he comes back empty handed. “There used to be jackfish, short mackerel, and many others … But now, the situation isn’t good. The weather isn’t like what it used to be,” Mr. Sommay laments. Coral reefs are both a food resource and habitat for marine life, as well as being natural barriers preventing coastal erosion, scientists say. If bleaching causes marine life to decrease, fishermen will need to spend more to get their catch, which could see selling prices rise, said Sarawut Siriwong, the dean of faculty of Marine Technology at Burapha University. “While this (coral bleaching) would affect food security, at the same time, their (community) income stability is also at stake,” he said. –Reuters",https://www.bworldonline.com/world/2024/05/23/596968/boiling-not-warming-marine-life-suffers-as-thai-sea-temperatures-hit-record/
Taiwan dispatches forces to areas around island after China starts ‘punishment’ drills,Reuters,"May 23, 2024 | 11:32 am","TAIPEI/BEIJING–Taiwan’s military mobilized its forces and said it was confident it could protect the island, after China started two days of “punishment” drills around Taiwan on Thursday in what it said was a response to “separatist acts”. The exercises, in the Taiwan Strait and around groups of Taiwan-controlled islands that sit next to the Chinese coast, come just three days after Lai Ching-te took office as Taiwan’s new president, a man Beijing detests as a “separatist”. China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, has denounced Lai’s inauguration speech on Monday, in which he called on China to stop its threats and on Tuesday Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called Lai “disgraceful“. Lai has repeatedly offered talks with China but been rebuffed. He says only Taiwan’s people can decide their future, and rejects Beijing’s sovereignty claims. The Eastern Theatre Command of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) said it had started joint military drills, involving the army, navy, air force and rocket force, in areas around Taiwan at 7:45 a.m. (2345 GMT). The drills are being conducted in the Taiwan Strait, the north, south and east of Taiwan, as well as areas around the Taiwan-controlled islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu and Dongyin, the command said in a statement. Taiwan’s defense ministry condemned the drills, saying that it had dispatched forces to areas around the island and was confident it could protect its territory. “The launch of military exercises on this occasion not only does not contribute to the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait, it also highlights (China’s) militaristic mentality,” the ministry said. A senior Taiwan official, speaking anonymously given the sensitivity of the matter, told Reuters that the drills are part of a scenario Taiwan had anticipated and that the island’s government has a “comprehensive grasp” of Chinese military movements. Taiwanese officials had said in the run-up to the inauguration they were keeping watch for Chinese military movements. The drills focus on joint sea-air combat-readiness patrols, precision strikes on key targets, and integrated operations inside and outside the island chain to test the “joint real combat capabilities” of the forces, China’s military said. “This is also a strong punishment for the separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces and a stern warning against the interference and provocation by external forces,” the command added. Chinese state media published a map of the drills zones, in five areas all around Taiwan and the islands Taiwan controls near the Chinese coast. Su Tzu-yun, a research fellow at Taiwan’s top military think tank, the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, said that although the drills would only last two days, the scope is large relative to previous exercises, as they included Taiwan’s outlying islands. This is designed to demonstrate China’s ability to control the seas and prevent the involvement of foreign forces, he added. “The political signals here are greater than the military ones,” he added. There was no sign of alarm in Taiwan, where people are long used to Chinese military activity. The benchmark stock index.TWII,currently at a historic high,wasup 0.2%on Thursday morning. “The drills will have a short-term psychological impact, but won’t reverse the long-term upward trend of Taiwan stocks,” said Mega International Investment Services vice president Alex Huang. In August 2022, China launched live-fire military exercises around Taiwan immediately after a visit, much condemned by Beijing, by former U.S. House speaker Nancy Pelosi. That series of exercises, the scale of which was unprecedented, lasted for four days, followed by several days of additional drills. –Reuters",https://www.bworldonline.com/world/2024/05/23/596971/taiwan-dispatches-forces-to-areas-around-island-after-china-starts-punishment-drills/
"Reeling from one heat wave, Mexico awaits ‘highest temperatures ever recorded’",Reuters,"May 23, 2024 | 11:36 am","MEXICO CITY–Mexico, reeling from a heat wave that has alreadybroken records, causedpower outagesand killed people andanimals, could see “unprecedented” temperatures over the next two weeks, the country’s largest university warned on Wednesday. The extreme heat, fueled partly by the most recent El Nino weather phenomenon, will arrive with 70% of Mexico in drought and a third in severe drought, according to data from the national water commission. “In the next 10 to 15 days, the country will experience the highest temperatures ever recorded,” researchers from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) said in a statement. Temperatures in the capital could reach a record 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) in the next two weeks, said Jorge Zavala, director of UNAM’s Institute of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate Change. Most of the metropolitan area’s 21 million residents – accustomed to more temperate weather – lack air conditioning. Earlier this month, the capital was one of at least ten cities in Mexico that registered their hottest day on record. Mexican health ministry data shows at least 26 people have died from heat-related causes between the start of the hot season on March 17 and May 11. The heat has also taken a toll on some threatened species, including howler monkeys, which have been dying from suspected dehydration in southern Mexico. In the city of Leon in the central state of Guanajuato on Tuesday, a caretaker provided water for geese and ducks after a nearby dam reservoir dried up. “We have to help them a little because they suffer,” said Carlos Cuevas, the caretaker. Under a tent near the parched reservoir, Alfonso Cortes, a local Catholic archbishop, led a mass for rain as parishioners fanned themselves in the heat. “We are going to pray that the Lord will send our state and all human beings the gift of water,” Mr. Cortes said. “Everything revolves around our life and water.” –Reuters",https://www.bworldonline.com/world/2024/05/23/596975/reeling-from-one-heat-wave-mexico-awaits-highest-temperatures-ever-recorded/
Dollar hovers near highest in a week after hawkish Fed minutes,Reuters,"May 23, 2024 | 11:25 am","TOKYO–The dollar hovered near a one-week high on Thursday following its best day this month against its major peers afterminutesof the last Federal Reserve meeting revealed a willingness to raise interest rates among some officials. Sterling remained firm after jumping to a one-month peak following hotter-than-expectedinflation, and also drew support from the announcement of a UK parliamentary election for July 4. The yen languished just above a three-week low despite the continued threat of intervention by Japanese officials. Ether continued to hover near Tuesday’s more than two-month peak amid speculation over the potential approval of U.S. spot exchange-traded funds that would track the world’s second-biggest cryptocurrency. The dollar index=USD, which tracks the currency against six major rivals including the euro, sterling and yen, was little changed at 104.89 after gaining 0.28% overnight. Fed officials at their April 30-May 1 session indicated they still had faith that price pressures would ease, if only slowly, but the meeting summary also reflected discussion of possible tightening. “The minutes revealed concerns that inflation might not decline as quickly as hoped and that some members are open to further rate hikes if needed,” supporting the dollar, James Kniveton, senior corporate FX dealer at Convera, wrote in a note to clients. “Consequently, expectations for the first rate reduction have shifted from September to November. With the Federal Reserve meeting occurring just after the U.S. elections, early November could see significant market volatility.” The dollar was little changed at 156.77 yenJPY=EBSafter rising to 156.85 overnight, the highest since May 1.

"Half of world’s mangroves under threat, says conservation group",Reuters,"May 23, 2024 | 11:40 am","SINGAPORE–Half of the world’s mangrove ecosystems are at risk of collapse as a result of human activity, rising sea levels and extreme weather, according to the latest survey by an international conservation group. Unless action is taken, a quarter of the world’s total mangrove areas could be completely submerged within 50 years, with critically endangered ecosystems in India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives expected to bear the brunt, said the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in an assessment published on Wednesday. “This global assessment has found that 50% of the mangroves worldwide are at risk of collapse, and that is much more than what we expected,” said Marcos Valderrabano, who runs the IUCN’s “Red List” assessing ecosystem threats. Mangrove forests cover around 15% of the world’s coastlines and play a vital ecological and economic role, filtering water and providing breeding grounds for fish and other marine life. As well as storing an estimated 11 billion tons of carbon, mangroves also serve as an important buffer that protects coastal communities against storm surges and floods. Singapore, which lost almost all of its coastal mangrove habitats as a result of extensive land reclamation, is currently planning a restoration program that will help defend its low-lying coastline against rising sea levels. Switzerland-based IUCN assembled more than 250 experts to conduct the survey, and found that climate change was already affecting the spatial distribution of mangrove forests. Damaging ecosystem changes were also being driven by the widespread diversion of freshwater for irrigation purposes, it said. Mr. Valderrabano said mangroves need help to adapt to climate change and become more resilient. “This will be vital if we want to prevent some mangrove ecosystems from disappearing altogether,” he said. –Reuters",https://www.bworldonline.com/world/2024/05/23/596978/half-of-worlds-mangroves-under-threat-says-conservation-group/
Philippines implements single electronic invoicing system for imports,Kyle Aristophere T. Atienza ,"May 20, 2024 | 12:31 am","THE PHILIPPINE governmenthas enforced a single electronic invoicing system for all imported commodities, as it explores nonmonetary measures to address rising food prices. Under Administrative Order (AO) No. 13 signed by President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. on May 13, the country will implement digital and integrated pre-border technical verification and cross-border electronic invoicing for all imported commodities entering the country. A single electronic invoicing system is necessary to “effectively monitor international trade transactions of all imported goods,” according to the order. It would also “strengthen national security, safeguard consumers’ rights, and protect the environment against sub-standard and dangerous imported goods,” the order read. The new system, which the Bureau of Customs (BoC) shall implement within two years, will be enforced gradually. The first phase covers agricultural goods including fresh and frozen meat,fish and other aquatic resources, cereals, fruits, vegetables, and feeds. The second phase covers non-agricultural goods with health and safety issues, while the last phase will cover other goods with misdeclaration to avoid duties and taxes. The AO also created a Committee for Pre-border Technical Verification and Cross-border Electronic Invoicing, which will be chaired by the Finance secretary. The committee’s members include the secretaries of the departments of Agriculture, Trade, energy, Health, Environment and Natural Resources, and Information Communications Technology. Committee members also include the BoC commissioner, director-general of Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, and two non-voting representatives from duly recognized industry associations to be appointed by the chairperson upon the committee’s recommendation. Funding for the order’s implementation would be charged against the available appropriations of the BoC and other members of the committee, according to the order. The new system followed the issuance of an AO mandating the Agriculture department as well as the Trade and Finance agencies to further ease procedures for agricultural imports and remove non-tariff barriers. Non-tariff barriers are policy measures that restrict trade such as quotas, import licensing systems, regulations and red tape, among others, according to AO 20. Inflation accelerated for a third straight month to 3.8% in April from 3.7% in March. It also marked thefifth straight month that inflation settled within the BSP’s 2-4% target range. Food inflation rose to 6.3% in April from 5.7% in March. Inflation averaged 3.4% in the January-April period, below the central bank’s 3.8% full-year forecast. —Kyle Aristophere T.

Muted remittance growth seen to further dampen consumption, L.M.J.C.Jocson ,"May 21, 2024 | 12:31 am","MUTED REMITTANCE growthin the coming months will continue to dampen household spending in the Philippines, Pantheon Macroeconomics said. “The support remittances are providing to private consumption in the Philippines remains sub-par,” it said in its weekly Emerging Asia economic monitor. Pantheon Macroeconomics noted that the growth of remittance inflowsin peso terms slowed to 4.6% year on year in March from 5.3% in February. However, average growth rose to 4.9% in the first quarter from 0.9% in the fourth quarter. “But this was down solely due to currency effects rather than an actual improvement in US dollar transfers, a year-over-year lift that is more likely to wane than grow in the second half,” Pantheon Macroeconomics said. It noted that remittance growth in peso terms is “now below the historical average for a 10thconsecutive month.” “This underperformance is likely only to worsen, looking at the lackluster momentum since the start of the year,” it added. Data from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) showed cash remittances rose by 2.5% to $2.74 billion in March from $2.67 billion a year ago. It was the slowest growth since 2.1% in June 2023. In the first quarter, cash remittances grew by 2.7% to $8.22 billion from $8 billion a year earlier. The BSP expects cash remittances to grow by 3% this year. Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. Chief Economist Michael L. Ricafort said it is still possible to meet the central bank’s remittance target this year. “The higher US dollar-peso exchange rate by more than 4% since the start of 2024 and more than 13% over the past two years or since the Russia-Ukraine conflict started in February 2022 could help reduce the need to send more remittances, with more peso equivalent, that are also needed to cope with higher prices locally from the point of view of overseas Filipino worker (OFW) families,” he said. Cash remittances that fuel household spending, account for about three-fourths of the economy. Private consumption grew by 4.6% in the first quarter, slower than 5.3% in the previous quarter and 6.4% a year ago. This was the slowest since the 4.8% drop in the first quarter of 2021. —L.M.J.C.Jocson",https://www.bworldonline.com/top-stories/2024/05/21/596390/muted-remittance-growth-seen-to-further-dampen-consumption/
BSP has room to ease before Fed," Luisa Maria Jacinta C. ,Jocson, ","May 20, 2024 | 12:34 am","ByLuisa Maria Jacinta C.Jocson,Reporter THE BANGKO Sentral ngPilipinas(BSP) still has room to cut rates before the US Federal Reserve, analysts said, but warned of such a move’s impact on the peso. Last week, BSP Governor Eli M. Remolona, Jr. signaled that the central bank could start rate cuts as early as August, even as he expects the US central bank to begin easing in September. “It is a positive signal, indicating that the BSP believes the Philippine economy is well-positioned to handle a slight divergence from the Fed’s monetary policy stance,” Security Bank Corp. Chief Economist Robert Dan J. Roces said in a Viber message. Last week, the Monetary Board (MB) maintained its target reverse repurchase (RRP) rate at a 17-year high of 6.5% for a fifth straight meeting. However, Mr. Remolona said the BSP may cut rates in August, possibly by 25 basis points (bps). “Such a scenario is not impossible if domestic inflation remains under control, but it risks both higher imported inflation down the road and capital flight, especially in times of high geopolitical tensions,” Makoto Tsuchiya, economist at Oxford Economics, said in a note. Bank of the Philippine Islands Lead Economist Emilio S. Neri, Jr. said that the possibility of the BSP cutting ahead of the Fed cannot be ruled out. “If local inflation dynamics improve so dramatically that it outweighs the exchange rate pass through impact of a series of reserve requirement ratio (RRR) and RRP cuts, the BSP MB may have room to cut ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC),” Mr. Neri said in a Viber message. Mr. Roces noted that the BSP governor’s willingness to consider rate cuts ahead of the Fed “suggests that the BSP is either more confident in the stability of the domestic economy and the anchoring of inflation expectations, or that it may be worried about the potential impact of prolonged elevated rates to the economy.” The economy grew by 5.7% in thefirst quarter, better than 5.5% in the previous quarter but slower than the 6.4% expansion a year earlier. The government is targeting 6-7% growth for the full year. IMPACT ON PESOHowever, Mr. Roces said if the BSP cuts rates ahead of the Fed, the challenge is “to carefully balance the benefits of lower rates with the risksof capital outflows and currency depreciation.” “When a central bank lowers interest rates while other major central banks maintain higher rates, it can make the currency less attractive to foreign investors seeking higher yields,” he said. “This could lead to capital outflows and depreciation pressure on the peso because of a narrower interest rate differential. 2022 comes to mind, when the Fed hiked and we didn’t and sent the peso to near P60,” he added. Mr. Remolona has said he is not worried about cutting ahead of the Fed and its potential impact on the peso, noting that there would only be a bit of pressure on the currency. Mr. Roces said Mr. Remolona’s statement indicates that the BSP sees the impact on the peso as “manageable.” “This view may be based on factors such as the Philippines’ strong economic fundamentals, that the peso’s current depreciation may be just temporary, adequate foreign exchange reserves, and the potential for the rate cut to stimulate domestic growth and attract foreign investment in the longer term,” he added. The peso closed at P57.62 against the dollar on Friday, depreciating by 15.5 centavos from its P57.465finish on Thursday. Week on week, the peso also weakened by 20 centavos from its P57.42finish on May 10. The peso sank to the P57 level in mid-April, mainlydriven by the conflict in the Middle East. “If forthcoming US inflation and growth data increasingly improve the odds of Fed cuts, BSP can also cut ahead of the Fed without necessarily causing too much exchange market pressure,” BPI’s Mr. Neri said. On the other hand, some analysts said that the BSP is still unlikely to cut before the Fed. “We continue to expect the BSP to only cut after the Fed. Our baseline scenario is for the Fed to begin its easing cycle in the fourth quarter of 2024, starting with a 25-bp rate cut,” HSBC economist for ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Aris D. Dacanay said in a report. HSBC sees the BSP cutting rates by 25 bps in the fourth quarter to end the year with a benchmark rate of 6.25%. In a commentary, Nomura Global Markets Research said a cut by BSP in August is “still unlikely,” citing persistent inflation and the current account deficit. Nomura Global Markets said this suggests a need for BSP to “keep interest rate differentials supportive of the currency and keep imported inflation in check.” The BSP last week reiterated its outlook that inflation could temporarily overshoot the 2-4% target range from May to July due to positive base effects. “Overall, we do not believe BSP turned decisively dovish (last week), much less opened the door to rate cuts in the near term. We would put more weight on the hawkish policy statement,” Nomura said. Mr. Remolona had said that he was “less hawkish” but still noted that risks to the inflation outlook remain on the upside. Nomura expects the BSP to cut rates by a total of 50 bps this year, starting with a 25-bp cut in October. RRR CUTLast week, Mr. Remolona also said that he is seeking to reduce the RRR to 5% from the current 9.5%. The BSP reduced the ratio for big banks and nonbankfinancial institutions with quasi-banking functions by 250 bps to 9.5% in June 2023. The central bank has brought down the RRR for universal and commercial banks to a single-digit level from a high of 20% in 2018. Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. Chief Economist Michael L. Ricafort said that the BSP may reduce its RRR once it also starts policy easing. “Any further cut in RRR could infuse more liquidity into thefinancial system in terms of more loanable funds for banks that could also reduce intermediation costs and help further spur loan or credit growth and demand, which, in turn, would help further stimulate more business and economic activities,” he said in a Viber message. Mr. Ricafort said that a cut of one percentage point could infuse roughly P146 billion into the banking system as this would mean more loanable funds by the largest banks. The RRR is the percentage of bank deposits and deposit substitute liabilities that banks cannot lend out and must set aside in deposits with the BSP.",https://www.bworldonline.com/top-stories/2024/05/20/596068/bsp-has-room-to-ease-before-fed/
Finance department says no plan to further raise sin tax rates,B.M.D.Cruz,"May 20, 2024 | 12:32 am","THE DEPARTMENT of Finance (DoF) is not planning to raise taxes on “sin” products but is closely looking into the mounting tax losses due to illegal importation of cigarettes. “We will not impose any hike except for the existing [rates,]” Finance Undersecretary and Chief Economist Domini S. Velasquez said at a forum hosted by theEconomic Journalists Association of the Philippines and San Miguel Corp. at the weekend. The government imposes so-called “sin” taxes or excise taxes on certain goods such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco products in order to discourage consumption. Ms. Velasquez said the DoF is not keen on increasing tax rates that may stoke inflation. Instead, she said the department is “really zeroing in on how to improve administrative efficiency.” Signed into law in January 2020, Republic Act No. 11467 increased the excise tax on electronic cigarettes and alcoholic products to fund the Universal Health Care (UHC) law. For instance, the ad valorem tax was increased to 22% of the net retail price of distilled spirits. The specific tax was raised to P42 per proof liter in 2020, to P47 per proof liter in 2021, to P52 in 2022, to P59 in 2023, and to P66 in 2024. Under the law, the tax rate for tobacco products would be increased by 5% yearly starting Jan. 1, 2024. “Higher sin taxes could lead to some increase in inflation but the weight in the inflation/CPI (consumer price index) basketis relatively smaller,” Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. Chief Economist Michael L. Ricafort said in a Facebook Messenger chat. Excise tax collection contributes around 12% to the Bureau of Internal Revenue’s overall collection. Aside from alcohol and tobacco, excise taxes are imposed on petroleum and minerals, among others. Data from the DoF showed the sin tax collection reached P65.3 billion in 2022, 23% higher than the previous year. DoF’s Ms. Velasquez said the department is looking into the rampant smuggling of cigarettes into the country, which has resulted in millions in revenue losses for the government. “One of the things being looked at is possibly illicit cigarette trade. This could possibly be one of the gaps in terms of tax collections,” Ms. Velasquez said in a Viber message. Mr. Ricafort said the government should ensure “greater enforcement of the law also versus smuggling and other illegal activities that also reduce the government’s tax revenue collections.” He said the government should strengthen measures against tax evasion, run after tax cheats, and encourage tax payment compliance. Earlier this month, the BIR seized 227,351 packs of illicit cigarettes during a raid of warehouses in Brooke’s Point, Palawan. The BIR estimated the illegal importers of these cigarettes were responsible for P150.7 million in tax liabilities. —B.M.D.Cruz",https://www.bworldonline.com/top-stories/2024/05/20/596066/finance-department-says-no-plan-to-further-raise-sin-tax-rates/
"PHL needs at least 6.1% growth to meet target, say analysts","Beatriz Marie D. Cruz, ","May 20, 2024 | 12:33 am","ByBeatriz Marie D. Cruz,Reporter THE PHILIPPINE ECONOMYmust grow by an average of 6.1% forthe rest of the year to meet the lower end of the government’s6-7%target, the Department of Finance(DoF) said over the weekend. “We need 6.1% [growth] for the rest of the year to actually reach the 6% target. I think that’s very achievable,” Finance Undersecretary and Chief Economist Domini S. Velasquez said during a forum organized by the Economic Journalists Association of the Philippines and San Miguel Corp. The Philippine economy expanded by 5.7% in thefirst quarter, slightly faster than 5.5% in the previous quarter, but below the government’s 6-7% target band. For the coming months, the DoF expects higher spending and declining inflation to drive growth. “We expect that consumption will increase as inflation continues to moderate,” Ms. Velasquez said. Household consumption, which accounts for about 80% of GDP, grew by 4.6% in the January-to-March period, the slowest since the coronavirus pandemic. It was also weaker than 5.3% in the fourth quarter and 6.4% in the same period last year. “Once we have a bit of stable inflation, we do think that this will increase and it will prop up growth because those are the heavy lifters of growth,” Ms. Velasquez said. Calixto V. Chikiamco, Foundation for Economic Freedom (FEF) president, saidfirst-quarter consumption was hampered by rising prices of food. “The government needs to tackle the high food prices, which are discouraging consumption, and also forcing the BSP (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) to maintain higher interest rates for longer, despite slowing inflation,” he said in a Viber message. Last week, the BSP’s Monetary Board maintained its target reverse repurchase (RRP) rate at a 17-year high of 6.5% for afifth straight meeting. However, he noted a proposed amendment to the Rice Tariffication Law authorizing the NFA to directly import rice “will only exacerbate the deficit but will also be ineffective.” The House of Representatives is expected to approve the measure on third reading this week. To tame food prices, Mr. Chikiamco called on the government to further cut rice tariffs to 10% from 35%, and expand the Minimum Access Volume for corn, chicken and pork. SPENDINGGovernment spending is expected to pick up for the rest of the year, Ms. Velasquez said, after slowing to 1.7% in thefirst quarter. Faster exports and an improving job market should also sustain the economy’s growth prospects, Ms. Velasquez also noted. “China is showing signs of recovery which will benefit the Philippines. Additionally, the global outlook for the technology sector is positive, which will benefit exports of semiconductors,” she said. Ms. Velasquez said the Philippines will also benefit as global sales of semiconductors are projected to increase this year. However, she noted that growth in the manufacturing sector is being hampered by high power costs, which would be addressed by the passage of the CREATE MORE (CREATE to Maximize Opportunities for Reinvigorating the Economy) bill. Under CREATE MORE, corporations will be granted a 200% deduction for power costs incurred during the Income Tax Holiday period. Security Bank Corp. Chief Economist Robert Dan J. Roces said the government should ramp up infrastructure spending, attract more private sector investments, and support high potential sectors like agriculture and manufacturing to reach their targets. “The government can bolster its spending to contribute to growth by prioritizing high-impact infrastructure projects, improving budget execution, encouraging public-private partnerships, providing targeted support to key sectors, and investing in social infrastructure,” he said in a Viber message. There are currently 185 infrastructureflagship projects worth P9.14 trillion in the pipeline, according to the National Economic and Development Authority. However, Ateneo de Manila economics professor Leonardo A. Lanzona said the government appears to be focusing on inflation as the main constraint to growth. “But that is not true. Growth can be achieved even in the midst of inflation which to some extent can be a consequence of growth,” he said in a Facebook Messenger chat. He cited Japan and Singapore, which implemented policies to support domestic production particularly in high-tech industries, which helped grow their respective economies amid high inflation and interest rates. “The Philippines is an interesting case since economic growth was lower than expected and yet inflation remained high. This suggests the beginnings of stagflation,” Mr. Lanzona said. “The incapacity of the institutions to adapt to changing conditions and the insistence that things are ‘business as usual’ has led to poor policies and the failure to maximize the full potential of the Filipino.”",https://www.bworldonline.com/top-stories/2024/05/20/596067/phl-needs-at-least-6-1-growth-to-meet-target-say-analysts/
DBCC set to review revenue targets,Beatriz Marie D. Cruz,"May 21, 2024 | 12:32 am","THE GOVERNMENT is keeping its revenue targets for now, although a review by the Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC) is scheduled next month. “We’re keeping the targets. [We] will make a review [by the] end of June,” Finance Secretary Ralph G. Recto told reporters in a Viber message on Monday. This comes as the Department of Finance (DoF) reiterated that it would not push new tax measures to avoid fanning inflation. Finance Undersecretary and Chief Economist Domini S. Velasquez over the weekend said the DoF would rely on nontax revenue to meet collection targets. “Nontax revenue is actually a short-term solution… We were expecting that this year. I think the intent is not to impose new taxes,” she said during a forum organized by the Economic Journalists Association of the Philippines and San Miguel Corp. at the weekend. The DoF has been looking for ways to generate much-needed revenue as Mr. Recto earlier said he does not plan to introduce any new taxes this year. Ms. Velasquez said the DoF is not planning to push “inflation-inducing” taxes. “We do recognize that (the targets are) challenging. That’s why we have in place the nontax revenues,” she added. Nontax revenues refer to collections from government services, including regular fees and service charges, the privatization of state assets and dividends from government-owned and -controlled corporations (GOCC). Latest data from the DoF showed that nontax revenues stood at P206.4 billion as of April. The agency has been proposing initiatives to boost nontax revenues. Last week, Mr. Recto suggested selling the government’s stake in the Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway (SCTEx) to state pension funds. The DoF also raised the mandatory dividend remittances of GOCCs to the National Government to 75% of their annual net income in 2023 from 50%. Ms. Velasquez said the focus on nontax revenues would “buy time” for the department to ensure that its revenue-generating agencies can improve their collections. The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) is tasked to collect P3.055 trillion, while the Bureau of Customs’ (BoC) revenue target is at nearly P1 trillion. In thefirst four months of the year, the government collected P1.4 trillion in revenues or nearly a third of the full-year target, data from the Finance department showed. The BIR had collected P912.9 billion as of end-April, falling short of its P1.03-trillion goal for the period. On the other hand, the BoC collected P229.67-billion, exceeding its P288.53-billion target by 3.86%. Union Bank of the Philippines, Inc. Chief Economist Ruben Carlo O. Asuncion welcomed the DoF’s plan not to introduce new taxes. “New taxes are unpopular. People wouldn’t want to have new taxes especially that inflation and interest rates are high and impact spending of almost everyone,” he said in a Viber message. P&A Grant Thornton tax principal Eleanor L. Roque said the government’s ability to generate enough revenues without imposing new taxes would depend on its collection efficiency. “If there are untaxed sectors or inefficiencies in the collection efforts, the government can concentrate on plugging the loopholes and increased collection,” she said in a Viber message. “The government should also consider global tax developments such as BEPS (base erosion and profit shifting) to ensure that the taxes that should be paid in the Philippines is not paid to other jurisdictions just because we are late in adopting BEPS,” she added. To improve tax collection, Ms. Roque said the BIR should ensure that it has enough personnel or infrastructure to help taxpayers and improve tax collection. Meanwhile, the Finance department is also studying ways to improve tax collection in electronic commerce platforms, citing best practices in other Asian economies. “There could be missed [revenues] in e-commerce, especially those who moved from brick-and-mortar shops and now sell online,” Ms. Velasquez said in mixed English and Filipino. In a statement, the department said it is working to adopt best practices in digitalization from South Korea, Singapore and Japan to improve tax collection. The DoF will also meet with the Securities and Exchange Commissionand Bureau of Local Government Finance to “establish a comprehensive data-sharing agreement.” —Beatriz Marie D.

Senate OKs VAT on digital services,John Victor D. Ordoñez,"May 21, 2024 | 12:34 am","THE PHILIPPINE Senate on Monday approved on third and final reading a bill that seeks to impose a 12% value-added tax (VAT) on digital services provided by companies with no physical presence in the Philippines. All 23 senators voted in favor of Senate Bill No. 2528, which requires nonresident digital service providers to collect and remit VAT on all digital transactions of customers in the Philippines. Under the measure, nonresident digital service providers and electronic marketplaces must register with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) for the remittance of VAT on their services. Digital services refer to those provided over the internet or other electronic networks using information technology. These include online search engines, online marketplaces, cloud services, online media and advertising, online platforms and digital goods. If signed into law, the measure may cover e-commerce firms such as Amazon, Shein, Rakuten, Taobao, AliExpress and Temu, which do not have physical presence in the Philippines. The BIR commissioner can order the blocking or suspension of the services of digital providers if they fail to withhold and remit the 12% VAT. The bill exempts online courses, seminars and training programs offered by private educational institutions accredited by the Department of Education and Commission on Higher Education from remitting the tax. The services of banks and nonbankfinancial intermediaries including those delivering services through digital platforms are also exempt from remitting the VAT, according to a copy of the bill sponsored by Senator Sherwin T. Gatchalian. The measure also has a reverse charge mechanism that will require a VAT-registered taxpayer who receives the digital services from these nonresident foreign businesses and marketplaces to withhold and remit the VAT to the BIR. “This (measure) would level the playing field with local market players in terms of taxation and on top of principles in terms of taxation, this would also increase the government’s source of recurring revenues,” Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. Chief Economist Michael L. Ricafort said in a Viber message. The Department of Finance expects the bill to bring in P83.8 billion in revenue from 2024 to 2028. The House of Representatives approved a similar measure in November 2022. “This will increase tax revenues but may be detrimental to businesses as this is an additional burden that they may pass to consumers, making products more expensive,” John Paolo R. Rivera, president and chief economist at Oikonomia Advisory & Research, Inc., said in a Viber message. Meanwhile, the Senate also approved on third and final reading a bill seeking to set tougher penalties on those who usefinancial accounts to commit crimes. All 23 senators voted in favor of Senate Bill No. 2560, or the proposed Anti-Financial Account Scamming Act (AFASA), which sets jail time of at least six years and a fine of as much as P500,000 against those behind money mule schemes. People found guilty of fraud may face as long as 12 years in jail and a fine of at least P1 million, according to a copy of the measure sponsored by Senator Mark A. Villar. The bill also punishes those committing economic sabotage — deliberately disrupting a country’s economy, with life imprisonment and a fine of at least P1 million but not more than P5 million. Both measures approved on Monday are part of the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council’s priority bills. —John Victor D.

Oil firms told to hike biodiesel blend by October," Sheldeen Joy Talavera, ","May 21, 2024 | 12:33 am","BySheldeen Joy Talavera,Reporter THE DEPARTMENT of Energy (DoE) directed oil companies to increase the coco biodiesel blend starting October, in a bid to help reduce pump prices and support the local industry. In a circular, the DoE said all diesel fuel sold in the country should contain a biodiesel blend of 3% starting Oct. 1, from 2% now. Oil firms should increase the coco biodiesel blend to 4% by Oct. 1, 2025, and to 5% by Oct. 1, 2026. The Biofuels Act of 2006 mandates that all liquid fuels for motors and engines contain locally sourced biofuel components. Since February 2009, oil companies have been required to implement a 2% biodiesel blend by volume in all diesel fuel sold and distributed in the country. “Following the drastic increase in the cost of fuel over the past years as a consequence of the Ukraine-Russia conflict, production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Plus and global inflation, the National Biofuels Board (NBB) has determined that an increase in the bioethanol blend will reduce pump price of diesel and gasoline fuel and help alleviate the burden of rising prices on consumers,” according to the circular. The increase in the coco methyl ester (CME) blend from 2% to 5% was supposed to have been implemented in 2020 but was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. At that time, there was a lack of assurance on the sufficiency of biodiesel supply, as well as logistical limitations. Under the circular, the DoE said oil companies can also offer gasoline fuel containing 20% bioethanol blend on a voluntary basis. At present, the DoE has mandated a 10% bioethanol blend by volume into all gasoline fuel sold locally. In a statement, the DoE said increasing the bioethanol blend to 20% could result in a P3.21 per liter reduction in gasoline pump prices. “Implementing the higher biofuel blend is a win-win solution as we promote economic growth, uphold environmental stewardship and strive for cleaner energy utilization. It is also about investing in a future where sustainability drives progress,” Energy Secretary Raphael P.M. Lotilla said. The DoE said in the circular that the downstream oil industry should implement measures to ensure that all requirements for the transition to the higher biofuel blend are in place before the deadline. Oil firms should ensure there is sufficient storage capacity, blending facilities and transport systems to accommodate an expected increase in biofuel supply. Fuel retailers that implement the 20% bioethanol blend are also directed to provide a dedicated storage tank and dispensing pump. Vehicle owners should be informed before dispensing gasoline. Meanwhile, biofuel producers should ensure there is ample feedstock and production to meet the demand for higher biofuel blend. “The proposed increase in the ethanol blend in gasoline and the CME blend in diesel is part of the country’s efforts to reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and support the local bioethanol and biodiesel industries,” Rodela I. Romero, assistant director of the DoE Oil Industry Management Bureau, said in a Viber message. She said the new policy is part of government efforts to comply with environmental regulations, promote the use of “cleaner fuels” and support local industries. However, Terry L. Ridon, a public investment analyst and convenor of think tank InfraWatch PH, said the new policy “should have included a suspension mechanism in the event of unreasonable surges in global biodiesel and bioethanol prices.” He said allowing a price surge would defeat the government’s objective to mandate biofuels to ensure lower pump prices. “[The] government should focus on using local biofuel supply instead of relying heavily on importation for our blending requirements,” he said in a Viber message. Dean A. Lao, Jr., president of Chemrez Technologies, Inc., said the higher biodiesel blend is “long-time coming and much needed” by the agriculture industry. “There is so much local value adding to coconut oil and even more CO2 (carbon dioxide) displacement for the country. I am glad the biodiesel industry can be credited with such inclusive benefits for the Philippines,” he said. Chemrez, a subsidiary of publicly listed D&L Industries, Inc., operates the country’s first continuous-process biodiesel plant, according to its website. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) expects biofuel consumption to recover in 2024 as fuel ethanol demand is seen to grow by 8% to 682 million liters, while biodiesel demand is expected to inch up by 0.8% to 240 million liters. “The primary driver of this growth will be increases in the fuel pool, with potential for greater growth if higher blending standards are fully adopted,” the USDA said in its report.",https://www.bworldonline.com/top-stories/2024/05/21/596392/oil-firms-told-to-hike-biodiesel-blend-by-october/
Red Lobster food chain goes bankrupt after unlimited shrimp deal,Bloomberg,"May 23, 2024 | 12:07 am","SEAFOOD restaurant chain RedLobster filed for bankruptcy,succumbing to onerous leases, high labor costs, and a disastrous unlimited shrimp promotion. The Orlando, Florida-based company filed for Chapter 11 protection on Sunday, listing assets and liabilities of $1 billion to $10 billion each in its bankruptcypetition. The filing allows the company to keep operating while it works out a plan to repay creditors. Red Lobster plans to hand control of the company to its lenders, led by Fortress Investment Group, who have agreed to provide $100 million in financing to support the chain through bankruptcy. The takeover offer is in the form of a stalking horse bid, meaning it will set the floor price for Red Lobster’s assets and is subject to better bids should any materialize in the coming weeks, according to court documents. The restaurant chain had been deteriorating for several years, with diners down around 30% since 2019, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jonathan Tibus wrote in courtpapers. While the business had shown signs of recovery since the pandemic, sales declined sharply in the last 12 months, Tibus wrote. It lost $76 million in the 2023 fiscal year. Inflationary pressures have kept customers from dining out and higher labor costs strained the company’s finances. A “material portion” of Red Lobster’s leases were priced above market rates. In May 2023, the company changed its $20 “Ultimate Endless Shrimp” from a limited time offer to a permanent promotion, costing it $11 million as diners devoured expensive plates of shrimp. Red Lobster traces its roots to a single restaurant in Lakeland, Florida in 1968. It expanded rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s, and developed a loyal following for its Cheddar Bay Biscuits. The company now operates more than 550 restaurants in the US and Canada. The restaurant chain, which has been owned by seafood supplier Thai Union Group Plc since 2020, serves 64 million customers per year and purchases 20% of all North American lobster tails, as well as 16% of all rock lobsters worldwide. Thai Union and Red Lobster had been in talks with lenders for an out-of-court deal that would hand the creditors 80% of the company, but discussions fell through. Lenders made additional loans worth $20 million to Red Lobster in February, but they weren’t willing to put in more money without support from the owner, according to court papers. ENDLESS SHRIMPSMeanwhile, Thai Union disputed the contents of asworn statementfiled in bankruptcy court from Red Lobster CEO Jonathan Tibus, which included allegations that the seafood supplier “exercised an outsized influence on the company’s shrimp purchasing.” A Red Lobster lawyer read a statement from Thai Union during the restaurant chain’s first bankruptcy court hearing in Orlando, Florida on Tuesday. Thai Union disputes all statements concerning the company and its relationship to Red Lobster, the lawyer said. Mr. Tibus alleged the decision by former management in May 2023 to change its $20 “Ultimate Endless Shrimp” deal from a limited time offer to a permanent deal cost the company $11 million. The deal also saddled Red Lobster “with burdensome supply obligations, particularly with its equity sponsor, Thai Union,” he said. Ultimate Endless Shrimp was also heavily promoted in Red Lobster at its locations, which Mr. Tibus said was “atypical for the company” and led to major shrimp shortages at its restaurants. Some Red Lobster locations went days or sometimes weeks without certain types of shrimp, he said. A former Red Lobster executive also allegedly directed Thai Union to continue producing shrimp for its restaurants “that did not flow through the traditional supply process or bid cycle or adhere to the Company’s demand projections,” Mr. Tibus said. Former management also eliminated other suppliers of breaded shrimp, “leaving Thai Union with an exclusive deal that led to higher costs to Red Lobster,” he said. The chain employs 34,000 people in the US and an additional 2,000 in Canada. Last week, it shuttered 93 underperforming stores. The case is Red Lobster Management LLC, number 24-02486, in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida (Orlando). —Bloomberg",https://www.bworldonline.com/bloomberg/2024/05/23/596773/red-lobster-food-chain-goes-bankrupt-after-unlimited-shrimp-deal/
Cebu Pacific may finalize aircraft order by June,Ashley Erika O.

We will make the announcement, I think, in the next couple of months. Maybe by June,” Lance Y. Gokongwei, chairman of Cebu Air, said on the sidelines of the BusinessWorldEconomic Forum 2024. The budget carrier is planning to order more than 100 narrow-body aircraft from Boeing or Airbus valued at roughly $12 billion based on current list of prices, Cebu Pacific said. The airline company is nearing the completion of its aircraft order, which is expected to boost its overall fleet amid its plan to increase flight frequencies to serve the growing demand for air travel. “We are close to the finish line for [our aircraft order]. We have not put a date yet, but we are still close to the timetable,” Alex B. Reyes, chief strategy officer of Cebu Pacific, said separately on the sidelines of an aviation forum. Mr. Reyes, however, did not say if the company is leaning towards Airbus or Boeing for its planned aircraft order. Cebu Pacific currently operates a fleet of 73 Airbus and ATR aircraft, which it earlier said will double with its planned order of more aircraft this year. Last year, Cebu Air said it would lower its fleet growth rate for 2024 as engine maker Pratt & Whitney (P&W) inspects A320/321 NEO aircraft engines worldwide following suspected issues. Currently, between 10 to 20 aircraft of Cebu Pacific are parked because of the ongoing issue with global engine maker P&W.

"Tiny chef, new tricks",Joseph L. Garcia,"May 23, 2024 | 12:08 am","WHEN we went to Le Petit Chef two years ago and saw a tiny hologram fix our dinner (that’s our story and we’re sticking to it), we thought we had seen it all. Then last year, Le Petit Chef at the Grand Hyatt Manila had a new schtick — recreating Marco Polo’s travels for the diner. The concept has changed once again, and the Grand Hyatt guided us through the experience through a tasting on May 14. Le Petit Chef is a project by Belgian-based company Skullmapping in 2015, and the idea has been brought to several cities around the world. During the meal, a projection of the chef (the size of a finger) and his world is shown on immaculate white tables, positioned with precision to create the illusion. While his first outing saw him in his native France, for this edition, Le Petit Chef has a different experience in store, with the goal being to teach diners how to be the world’s greatest chef. The first course took us to South America, to the civilizations that first cultivated the tomato. While the chef discusses the history of the tomato and how it arrived in Europe (we learned that day that the pewter plates used by European nobles reacted with the tomatoes, and led to poisoning; which earned the tomato a negative reception for a while). A marinated cherry tomato was served to us withburrata, Parmesan crumble, basil oil, and tomato sorbet (in the shape of a potato, another South American contribution). The next course was a course in art: here, the chef talked to the diners about his reverence for Russian artist Wassily Kandinsky, and how several art styles influenced his plating. The table settings were changed to have placemats in the shape of artists’ palettes, printed with several famous paintings. A pan-seared salmon was served with buttered asparagus, and purees of beetroot, basil, and lemon and pepper emulsions, splashed on the plate in the style of Kandinsky. The salmon was of exquisite quality and even with the “paint,” had a very mild flavor. The chef then took us on a more personal trip: back to his memories of an idyllic forest, camping with his grandmother. We watched them cook and in turns, beat and befriend various forest critters. The pair’s finished dish was a French Corn-fed Chicken Roulade with porcini mushrooms, truffle mushroom puree, and roasted chicken jus. It was wrapped in leaves and wonderfully earthy. The chef bursts into song (about cooking, in the style ofBeauty and the Beast’s “Be Our Guest”) to present the last savory course, a Surf and Turf platter with Australian grass-fed beef tenderloin with a black peppercorn brandy sauce; coupled with grilled king prawn in garlic butter, fondant potato, glazed carrot, and French beans. The dessert was a bit of a mystery: dressed up as we all were, we were handed blowtorches and syringes before the course was served. It turned out that we were to use these to brown Italian meringues and to pump cream onto our fly agaric “mushrooms” (the real mushroom has hallucinogenic properties, and the task given to us was certainly a trip). The mushroom, rouged with a red fruit glaze, was actually a white chocolate case holding white chocolate mousse andganacheinside, with different fruit jams at the mushroom’s stalk and cap. The program itself wasn’t the only change this year. The dinner’s venue moved from the Grand Hyatt’s upstairs bar The Peak, to the larger Gallery downstairs. According to the hotel’s Executive Chef Mark Hagan, it’s because they’re reopening The Peak once again as a nightclub, in response to the post-pandemic party boom. Another contribution of the party boom to the move downstairs is more seating: the former location could only accommodate 16 seats, but the new location in the Gallery allows for 28 seats. “We’re always getting a lot of requests,” he said. “We were nearly working on a 95% occupancy rate.” We must say that the new Le Petit Chef experience is a lot more sophisticated than what came before, but the new location must work on its acoustics (the miniature chef’s voice echoes around the room; and so did our dinner companions’, so we had a hard time hearing both). As exclusive holders of the Le Petit Chef contract in Manila, we asked Mr. Hagan why the chef was such a nice fit for the hotel. “We want to give people a dining experience which they can remember… a link to the hotel,” he said. “We’re here to bring families and people together and have memories.” Guests can choose the Le Grand Suite Stay and Dine Experience, priced at P32,888 net for two, which includes an overnight stay in a Grand Suite and daily breakfast at The Grand Kitchen, a Le Grand Chef Menu for two, access to the Grand Club Lounge, and a special welcome amenity upon arrival. Those who wish to only dine can opt for the Le Grand Chef Menu, priced at P7,500 net per person and a Le Petit Chef Kids Menu priced at P4,000 net per person.

Filipinos now spending more on home redesign post-COVID,"Joseph L. Garcia, ","May 22, 2024 | 12:31 am","ByJoseph L. Garcia,Senior Reporter THE GLOBAL coronavirus pandemic has forced Filipinos to rethink spaces and redesign certain areas of their home to make these more work-friendly. Business establishments such as restaurants have also renovated their spaces so they can offer more immersive and multisensory experiences to customers while fostering human connection. “The pandemic highlighted the need for adaptable living and working spaces that prioritized the health and safety of users,” Carla Mae Leonor, director of public relations at the Philippine Institute of Interior Designers, said in an interview. “With this come solutions that ensureflexibility, incorporating movable partitions, multifunctional furniture and convertible rooms to accommodate changing needs, such as remote work and distance learning,” she added. After being stuck at home for a long time, consumers are also seeking out experiences that can’t be replicated at home, the interior designer said. “From immersive and multisensory dining to events and spaces that foster human connection, these brought about new hospitality spaces that provide bubble-type sanctuaries that provide resort-style amenities within a controlled space,” she said. Some restaurants also offer dining experiences that include immersive and multi-sensory features that foster human connection, she added. Architect Carlos Cham noted that in thefirst two years of the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, his company Cham-Candelaria, Inc., which specialized in restaurant and residential clients, did not have any building projects. “All construction was put on hold for thefirst two years,” he said in an e-mail. “Construction only resumed, with very strict protocols, when the situation became lighter, and the vaccines started coming out.” Philippine building activity declined by 28.5% at the height of the pandemic in 2020, but started recovering in the following year by posting growth of 31.4%, according to data from the local statistics agency. Philippine construction had a market size of $65.2 billion (P3.7 trillion) in 2023 and it is expected to achieve an average annual growth rate of more than 7% from 2025 to 2028, according to a GlobalData report in March. The government’s focus on infrastructure and energy development will support market expansion in real terms this year, it added. “Fine-tuning every inch of Filipinos’ homes has become a way of cocooning to make their spaces enjoyable,” Ms. Leonor said. They have come to adopt themes such as outdoor living, “feel-good” designs and hospitality industry-inspired interiors. The kitchen has likewise been converted from a workspace into a living space, with more interiors attuned to hosting, she added. ‘RITUALS AND HABITS’“At-home entertaining will remain a popular choice for cautious consumers,” Ms. Leonor said. Other changes include improvements to workspaces at home due to the work-from-home or hybrid setup spawned by the pandemic. “Improvised workspaces are being replaced with comfortable long-term solutions,” she said. She also cited the rise of pet-friendly buildings. “Resilient in the face of the economic downturn, the pet economy will continue to thrive,” she said, noting that new themes in interior design include making more pet-friendly spaces. Mr. Cham said having open-air spaces for both residential and commercial projects has become a standard requirement. “Minimalist designs are sought after not only due to the clean aesthetics but also for their practicality and function,” the architect said. His clients also prefer more natural light and ventilation. “People really learned to appreciate this.” Ms. Leonor cited the rise of health-friendly materials in interior spaces. “While personal standards for health and safety can be subjective, there are guidelines that are followed by licensed interior designers,” she pointed out. One of these is the use of smart materials that deter or destroy bacteria. “Protective materials have become central to everyday living as hygiene and protection were ramped up in light of the coronavirus pandemic.” Consumers also no longer just protect themselves through clothing but also with the finishes that they use within their spaces, she said. While these have mostly been used by the healthcare sector, since the pandemic, sanitizing and microbe-fighting materials are making the jump to the commercial and residential sectors. Mr. Cham said clients who want to cut costs still use traditional concrete hollow blocks or reinforced concrete. Those who want faster construction time have turned to steel or pre-cast. “Cost and time will always be the main factors,” he said. “It still depends on how clients would want to have it.” Ms. Leonor said Filipinos should future-proof their spaces against future health catastrophes. “Rethinking how we look at value also puts our minds in the right place when we design our spaces,” she said. “Hiring licensed and professional designers, for example, can ensure the best solutions are explored and the needs of the space and the users are considered in the process of designing solutions.” Interior designers are up to date with the latest technologies and innovations and know best how to meet the needs of a client, whether they require special treatment to ensure safety, well-being and comfort, she said. She likewise noted that antimicrobial and antiviral finishes and technology coming into the market can now be used. People should choose suppliers with sustainability credentials to “ensure synthetic and chemical compounds do not just end in landfills or leach into wastewater post-purchase,” she added. One can also go local, thanks to efforts to create bio-based plant- and protein-derived fibers, textiles and materials “that create healthier alternatives and promote the use of locally designed and locally made products.” “The rituals and habits built during the pandemic have affected the preferences and priorities of consumers,” Ms. Leonor said. The past years highlighted the relationship between humans and the environment, and this shifted the appreciation of users for well-designed spaces and objects. “The spaces we inhabit are extensions of ourselves and are therefore worth investing in,” she said. This perspective will be carried on beyond the post-pandemic recovery and will push interior designers to develop ways to make people safer and healthier and their lives more enjoyable, she added. “Design will always continue to grow and adapt to users’ behaviors and needs,” Mr. Cham said.",https://www.bworldonline.com/top-stories/2024/05/22/596673/filipinos-now-spending-more-on-home-redesign-post-covid/
US households still feel pinched by inflation — Fed survey,Reuters,"May 23, 2024 | 12:31 am","US HOUSEHOLDS continued to feel pinched by inflation in late 2023 even as price pressures ebbed, the US Federal Reserve reported on Tuesday, with most Americans saying their financial situation had changed little in the past year, while parents reported times had gotten harder. About 72% of adults were doing OK financially as of October 2023, the Fed’s annual survey on household economics and decision-making showed. That was down from 78% in 2021 and the lowest since 2016, though little changed from 73% in 2022. The share of parents doing OK financially dropped by 5 percentage points to 64%, the lowest since 2015 when data collection began. Inflation remained the top financial concern, according to the report. It said 65% of adults said high prices had made their situations worse, even though consumer inflation fell sharply from about 9% in June 2022 to below 4% by the time the survey was taken. While 34% said their family’s monthly income had risen in the past year, 38% said their spending had also increased. About 63% of adults said they could cover a hypothetical $400 emergency expense using cash or its equivalent, the same as in 2022 but down from a record high of 68% in 2021. Covering rental housing costs was a greater challenge last year than in the year before, with 19% of renters saying they had been behind in the rent at some point in the prior year, up from 17% in 2022. Rental costs, which have proven to be among the reasons inflation has not eased as much as Fed policy makers had hoped, were up far more than inflation overall, with the median monthly rent rising by 10% to $1,100, according to the survey. The survey included responses from 11,000 people and was conducted in October. It was the latest in an array of pulse-taking of US consumers to show a generalized gloom hanging over Americans’ view of the economy and their own financial well-being even as growth has exceeded expectations, and the job market remains strong. Monthly surveys from other organizations like the Conference Board and the University of Michigan have shown a persistent pessimism that began about three years ago alongside the arrival of the highest inflation since the 1980s. ‘HIGHEST PRIORITY’The dourness registers with Fed officials who continue to see the effort to bring inflation back to the central bank’s 2% target as their top priority. The burden of rapid inflation “was felt early because goods prices and prices in the market went up faster than wages and income then, and so people definitely felt they were falling behind,” Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said at a conference in Florida this week. Wage gains have generally exceeded price increases over the last year, especially for the lowest earners. Still, consumers retain memories of the pain inflicted by price pressures, and surveys, including from the Fed, show how deeply that has become ingrained. “People don’t do that math continuously to know that they’re catching up,” Mr. Bostic said. “I think there’s just some lived experiences (that are) going to have to happen where people will at some point do a recalibration, but I don’t know exactly when that’s going to be,” he said. “And so, for me, it’s just we got to get inflation back to our target. And that’s got to be the highest priority.” —Reuters",https://www.bworldonline.com/top-stories/2024/05/23/596919/us-households-still-feel-pinched-by-inflation-fed-survey/
"Infrastructure spending increased by 15% in March, says Budget dep’t","Beatriz Marie D. Cruz, ","May 22, 2024 | 12:32 am","ByBeatriz Marie D. Cruz,Reporter STATE SPENDING on infrastructure rose by 15% in March as the government ramped up disbursements for public works and defense modernization projects, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) said. In its latest National Government (NG) disbursement report, spending on infrastructure and other capital outlays jumped by 15.1% to P96.3 billion in March from P83.7 billion in the same month last year. Month on month, infrastructure spending rose by a fifth from P79.4 billion in February. The uptick in March was attributed mainly to the Department of Public Works and Highways’ (DPWH) increased spending for the construction of road infrastructure. “The sharp increase was largely due to the strong spending performance of the DPWH for payment of progress billings (i.e., completed/partially completed works) for various road infrastructure programs (e.g., road and bridge networks, flood control/mitigation structures, right-of-way acquisition), alongside payment of mobilization fees/advances to contractors for infrastructure projects under the 2024 budget,” the department said in a press release. Infrastructure spending rose due to direct payments made by the Department of Transportation for foreign-assisted railway projects such as the Capacity Enhancement of Mass Transit Systems in Metro Manila and the Malolos-Clark Railway Project. The DBM said disbursements for the Department of National Defense’s (DND) Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) modernization program also contributed to the higher spending. For the first quarter, infrastructure and other capital outlays went up by10.2% to P216.8 billion from P196.7billion in the same period in 2023. Overall infrastructure disbursements, which include infrastructure components of subsidy/equity to government corporations and transfers to local government units (LGUs), rose by 9.3% year on year to P266.3 billion in the period ending March. “The sturdy growth of the total infrastructure spending resulted mainly from the implementation of road infrastructure projects of the DPWH and defense modernization projects of the DND, alongside the higher local development fund of LGUs — equivalent to 20% of their National Tax Allotment shares,” the department said. The Philippine Statistics Authority earlier reported that government-led construction grew by 12.4% in the first quarter, contributing 2.9 percentage points (ppts) to the construction sector’s 6.8% growth and around 0.44 ppt to the 5.7% quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) growth. Terry L. Ridon, a public investment analyst and convenor of think tank InfraWatch PH, said that efficient spending of public funds helped the government outpace last year’s infrastructure spending performance so far. “This means that the government has been more efficient in the disbursement of public funds compared to the previous year, particularly in terms of improving the absorptive capacity of agencies to implement projects,” he said in a Viber message. “What the government needs to avoid would be unexpected project delays, such as right-of-way concerns which can delay project implementation for months, even years,” he added. President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. earlier issued several Executive Orders to fast-track the approval process for the government’s infrastructureflagship projects as well as address right-of-way concerns. The DBM expects infrastructure spending to increase in the second quarter as the government ramps up construction projects and activities before the rainy season. “Disbursements are foreseen to gradually increase in the current quarter as the DPWH and other agencies with capital outlay projects capitalize on the summer season for their construction projects/activities.” Spending on government programs in health, education, agriculture, social and employment as well as the release government employees’ midyear bonus would also spur economic growth, DBM added. Government employees started receiving their midyear bonus on May 15. “These would hopefully help stir more economic activity and prop up growth, particularly in public construction, the services and industry sectors, as well as household final consumption,” it said. Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. Chief Economist Michael L. Ricafort expects faster infrastructure spending in the coming months. “There would be greater urgency to accelerate infrastructure spending and other government spending on other projects and programs, especially later in 2024 up to early 2025 in view of the preparations for the May 2025 midterm elections,” he said in a Facebook Messenger chat. He said the government needs to boost infrastructure spending to drive economic activity, noting that lackluster infrastructure spending had contributed to slower economic growth in 2023 and early 2024. The government’s infrastructure program for this year is set at P1.472 trillion, equivalent to 5.6% of GDP.",https://www.bworldonline.com/top-stories/2024/05/22/596670/infrastructure-spending-increased-by-15-in-march-says-budget-dept/
Peso hits 58:$1 as Fed stays hawkish," Luisa Maria Jacinta C. Jocson, ","May 22, 2024 | 12:34 am","ByLuisa Maria Jacinta C. Jocson,Reporter THE BANGKO SENTRAL ng Pilipinas (BSP) warned it will intervene in the foreign exchange market as the Philippine peso on Tuesday closed at the 58-per-dollar level for the first time in over 18 months. “The BSP continues to monitor the foreign exchange market but allows the market to function without aiming to protect a certain exchange rate. Nonetheless, the BSP will participate in the market when necessary to smoothen excessive volatility and restore order during periods of stress,” BSP Governor Eli M. Remolona, Jr. said in a statement. The peso closed at P58.27 per dollar on Tuesday, weakening by 37 centavos from its P57.90 finish on Monday.  This was the peso’s weakest close in more than 18 months or since it closed at P57.275 per dollar on Nov. 8, 2022. Tuesday was also the peso’s first time closing at the P58-per-dollar level since Nov. 10, 2022. The local unit opened Monday’s session at P57.97 against the dollar, which was also its intraday best. Its worst showing was at P58.28 versus the greenback. Year to date, it depreciated by P2.90 from its P55.37-per-dollar close on Dec. 29, 2023. Mr. Remolona noted the peso’s weakness against the US dollar was in line with other currencies in the region. “The dollar continued to strengthen as the Federal Reserve signaled delay in cutting interest rates,” he said. US Federal Reserve officials on Monday hesitated to declare that inflation is on a sustainable path to the 2% target rate, according to Reuters. A trader in an e-mail said that the depreciation of the peso was due to “continuous hawkish guidance” from Fed officials. The trader said that prospects of the BSP cutting ahead of the Fed may have also exerted pressure on the peso. Last week, Mr. Remolona hinted that the BSP can begin its policy easing cycle before the Fed, with the earliest rate cut possibly in August. “It is crucial to note that while the dollar-peso exchange rate is something that the BSP does not explicitly manage, the domestic central bank might consider adjusting policy rates once the weakness of the peso poses considerable upside risk on the medium-term inflation outlook,” the trader added. Security Bank Corp. Chief Economist Robert Dan J. Roces said that the BSP will “defend the peso as necessary and when very volatile.” “The peso’s weakness seems to be in-line with movement of other regional currencies. Add to that statements by several Fed officials last night reiterating hawkishness and last week’s dovish BSP sentiment which seem to have carried over in (Monday’s) and (Tuesday’s) sessions,” he said in a Viber message. Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. Chief Economist Michael L. Ricafort said in a Viber message that the US dollar-peso exchange rate was higher “after cautious and higher-for-longer signals from most Fed officials recently that partly reduced the odds of Fed rate cuts lately to less than two.” “It is important to note that the US dollar-peso exchange rate already posted a bigger increase compared to most ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) currencies since the start of 2024 (at +5.2%) and since the Russia-Ukraine conflict started on Feb. 22, 2022 (at +14%),” Mr. Ricafort said. Mr. Ricafort sees the peso trading between P58.15 and P58.35 on Wednesday. On the other hand, the trader sees the currency ranging from P58.1 to P58.35 on Wednesday. ‘MINIMAL’ IMPACTFinance Secretary Ralph G. Recto also on Tuesday said that the peso’s recent weak performance will only have a “minimal” impact on inflation. “The depreciation may cause upside pressure on inflation. But I expect it to be minimal. It is a concern, but not alarming,” he toldBusinessWorldin a Viber message. Headline inflation accelerated for a third straight month to 3.8% in April. In the first four months, inflation averaged 3.4%. The BSP expects inflation to settle at 3.5% this year. “Our number one mission is still to reduce food inflation and thereby reduce interest rates later on,” Mr. Recto added. The Monetary Board kept its benchmark rate at a 17-year high of 6.5% at its May meeting. The BSP raised borrowing costs by a cumulative 450 basis points from May 2022 to October 2023. The BSP has said that inflation may temporarily accelerate above the 2-4% target band in the next two quarters. Mr. Remolona has also said that risks to the inflation outlook remain tilted to the upside.",https://www.bworldonline.com/top-stories/2024/05/22/596672/peso-hits-581-as-fed-stays-hawkish/
Philippines’ BoP deficit widens,Luisa Maria Jacinta C. Jocson,"May 22, 2024 | 12:33 am","THE COUNTRY’S balance of payments (BoP) deficit widened in April as the government paid back foreign debt and the trade balance remained in a deficit, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) said. Data from the central bank showed the BoP position widened to a $639-million deficit in April from the $148-million gap a year ago. This was also a reversal from the $1.17-billion surplus recorded in March. The BoP measures the country’s transactions with the rest of the world at a given time. A deficit means more funds left the economy than what went in, while a surplus shows that more money entered the Philippines. “The BoP deficit in April 2024 reflected outflows arising mainly from the National Government’s (NG) net foreign currency withdrawals from its deposits with the BSP to settle its foreign currency debt obligations and pay for its various expenditures,” the central bank said in a statement. In thefirst four months, the BoP position swung to a deficit of $401 million from the $3.3-billion surplus posted a year ago. “Based on preliminary data, this cumulative BoP deficit reflected mainly the NG’s repayments of its foreign loans coupled with the continued trade in goods deficit,” it added. The trade deficit sharply narrowed to $3.18 billion in March from the $5.02-billion deficit a year ago. In thefirst quarter, the trade deficit shrank by 22.2% year on year to $11.24 billion. Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. Chief Economist Michael L. Ricafort said that the BoP deficit was due to payment of foreign obligations. This included the scheduled repayment of $365 million in matured Japanese yen bonds on April 12. In the first quarter, debt repayments jumped by 74% to P986.036 billion. These include the P93.37 billion in principal payments on external debt and P54.11-billion in interest payments on external debt. At its end-April position, the BoP reflected afinal gross international reserve (GIR) level of $102.6 billion, 1.4% lower than $104.1 billion as of end-March. The dollar reserves were enough to cover 5.8 times the country’s short-term external debt based on original maturity and 3.6 times based on residual maturity. It is also equivalent to 7.6 months’ worth of imports of goods and payments of services and primary income. An ample level of foreign exchange buffers safeguards an economy from market volatility and is an assurance of the country’s capability to pay debts in the event of an economic downturn. For thecoming months, Mr. Ricafort said that the BoP position could improve “partly due to proceeds of the National Government’s foreign currency-denominated borrowing that would also be added to the country’s BoP and GIR as well as from official development assistance and other multilateral sources.” In May, the government raised $2 billion from its issuance of the dual-tranche 10- and 25-year fixed-rate dollar bonds. This was the Philippines’ first global bond sale for this year. Mr. Ricafort also noted continued growth in remittances, business process outsourcing (BPO) revenues, foreign tourism receipts and foreign direct investments would help support the BoP position. This year, the BSP expects the country’s BoP position to end at a $700-million deficit, equivalent to 0.1% of GDP. —Luisa Maria Jacinta C.

NEDA backs push for rice imports by NFA,"Beatriz Marie D. Cruz, ","May 23, 2024 | 12:32 am","ByBeatriz Marie D. Cruz,Reporter THE NATIONAL Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) on Wednesday backed a proposal allowing the National Food Authority (NFA) to boost rice stocks through imports during emergencies amid spiraling prices. “I’m still in favor of strengthening the NFA’s role in buffer stocking for emergency purposes,” NEDA Secretary Arsenio M. Balisacan told reporters on the sidelines ofBusinessWorld’s economic forum. “There has to be a way of sourcing the buffer stocks in a way that won’t further destabilize the market,” he said in mixed English and Filipino. “That involves, under those circumstances where production is lacking, getting the buffer stock from imports.” If it can’t import directly, the agency should be allowed to buy rice stocks from importers to boost its stock, he added. The Philippines is hard-pressed to ensure that it has enough rice supply amid a prolonged dry spell brought by El Niño and the looming rains from La Niña. “Consumption is growing simply because the population is growing, so there is that gap,” Mr. Balisacan said. “When you have that gap, you have to have additional sources of supply.” Under the Rice Tariffication Law, the NFA can only keep its buffer stock by buying rice from local farmers.But the local shortage keeps the agency from fulfilling its mandate, Mr. Balisacan said. State auditors in 2022flagged the NFA’s failure to stock up on rice. The agency’s rice inventory ranged from 111,042 metric tons (MT) to 182,612 MT, far behind the national rice buffer stocking requirement of 300,000 MT, the Commission on Audit said. The House of Representatives on Tuesday passed on third andfinal reading changes to the law, including restoring the NFA’s regulatory power over the rice industry. House Bill No. 10381 empowers the NFA to import rice if there are no available local sources, upon the approval of the Agriculture secretary. The NFA may also require warehouses to register in its national database. The agency may also collect and analyze data on rice trading activities. Under the bill, a food security emergency includes a shortage in rice supply and extraordinary price increases. The Senate has yet to pass a counterpart measure. Mr. Balisacan said Administrative Order No. 20 issued by President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. last month would ensure timely and adequate farm imports. The President had ordered agencies to reduce nontariff barriers and administrative restrictions on farm imports. The government should not rely on the NFA alone to stabilize rice prices, Mr. Balisacan said. “We have been there, and we don’t want to go back to a regime that has been shown to not work.” Local regular milled rice costs P49.37 a kilo, while well-milled rice costs P51.28, according to the Agriculture department’s latest price watch. Imported regular milled rice and well-milled rice cost P49.61 and P52.50.",https://www.bworldonline.com/top-stories/2024/05/23/596916/neda-backs-push-for-rice-imports-by-nfa/
Peso’s nonstop fall may stoke prices,"Aaron Michael C. Sy, ","May 23, 2024 | 12:34 am","ByAaron Michael C. Sy,Reporter A PROLONGED depreciation of the Philippine peso could stoke inflation, though it could also benefit the economy by boosting export earnings, analysts said. “We see the peso’s weakness against the dollar persisting,” Ruben Carlo O. Asuncion, chief economist at Union Bank of the Philippines, Inc., said in a Viber message on Wednesday. “The BSP has to be ready, as they have done in the past, to intervene and battle volatility and speculative play,” he added. Diwa C. Guinigundo, country analyst at GlobalSource Partners, said the peso’s weakness could boost export competitiveness “as long as its pass-through to inflation does not exceed the benefits of external competitiveness.” “That is growth positive,” he said in a Viber message. “As long as the peso avoids a sharp and prolonged depreciation, the impact on inflation could be manageable. Otherwise, imported inflation could be very problematic.” The peso closed at P58.06 against the dollar, 21 centavos stronger than on Tuesday, when it closed at the weakest level in 18 months, according to Bankers Association of the Philippines data. The currency has depreciated by P2.69 this year from its P55.37-a-dollar close on Dec. 29, 2023. Mr. Guinigundo, a former central bank deputy governor, said the peso could strengthen if the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) turns more hawkish again. “Any hint of the BSP’s less hawkish stance could move the market,” he added. BSP Governor Eli M. Remolona, Jr. last week said the central bank could cut rates as early as August and earlier than the Fed amid easing inflation. He also expects one or two 25-basis-point rate cuts in the second half. The peso is likely to be dragged down by the widening balance of payment (BoP) deficit, Mr. Guinigundo said. The payment position widened to a $639-million deficit in April from the $148-million gap a year earlier, according to BSP data. This was also a reversal of the $1.17-billion surplus in March. The BSP expects the country’s BoP position to end at a $700-million deficit, equivalent to 0.1% of economic output. Juan Paolo E. Colet, managing director at China Bank Capital Corp., said the peso’s weakness could affect companies with dollar loans. “Our currency’s weakness will have an impact on companies that have borrowed in US dollars but whose revenues are mainly in peso, because it becomes more expensive to [pay] the debt,” he said in a Viber message. The peso has been weaker than its regional peers, and it’s mainly depreciating due to the Philippine central bank’s dovish tone, Emilio S. Neri, Jr., lead economist at Bank of the Philippine Islands, said in a Viber message. “The Philippine economy’s narrowing current account deficit combined with possible softening of forthcoming US inflation may cap what seems to be a near-term overshoot of the exchange rate versus its expected medium-term trend,” he added. The BSP estimates a $6.1-billion current account deficit this year, or 1.3% of economic output. Companies welcome an earlier rate cut by the BSP because it is a sign of slowing inflation, Jonathan L. Ravelas, senior adviser at Reyes Tacandong & Co., said in a Viber message. Inflation quickened to 3.8% in April from 3.7% in March, still within the central bank’s 2-4% target for the year. It was slower than 6.6% a year earlier. It averaged 3.4% in the first four months, below the BSP’s 3.8% full-year forecast.

Ochave,Reporter THE PHILIPPINE government and privatesector should harness the potentials of education, manufacturing and tourism, which are critical to economic growth, JG Summit Holdings, Inc.’s top executive said on Wednesday. The state should serve as a “key enabler”by facilitating the cost and ease of doing business, while private companies should continue to invest, create jobs and wealth to improve lives, JG Summit President and Chief Executive Officer(CEO) Lance Y. Gokongwei said in a speech atBusinessWorld’s economic forum in Taguig City. “Underlying these three critical areas is, of course, the importance of both physical and technological infrastructure that will support and further hasten the growth of our human capital, manufacturing sector and tourism industry,” he added. Mr. Gokongwei said young Filipinos should have skills to let them keep up with an economy driven by technology, while teachers should be upskilled and reskilled in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. He added that with an adequately equipped workforce, the government and business can “confidently woo global capital to pitch their tents in our country based on the undeniable resources we offer.” Mr. Gokongwei said revitalizing the manufacturing sector would also boost the economy. “Our industrialization hinges on the government and private sectors jointly identifying and agreeing on the manufacturing industries that we need to develop, supported by enabling policies and incentives,” he said. The bid to become a manufacturing economy also depends on the country’s ability to equip its workforce so it can meet the demands of the emerging industrial and technological landscape. Mr. Gokongwei added that both direct and indirect tourism receipts should form part of the Philippines’ economic growth plans. “Our natural wonders, our kindhearted people, and our ideal location — these are the perfect ingredients to make us a tourism powerhouse with significant contributions to our gross domestic product,” he said. Philippine economic prospects remained bright despite risks and challenges, National Economic and Development Authority Secretary Arsenio M. Balisacan told the forum in a separate speech. “The Philippines’ prospects remain bright and amidst current projections, we are working hard to keepour fundamentals sound,” he said. “Despite some of the greatest challenges we have ever faced, we remain committed to meeting our short-term goals. We aim for no less than socioeconomic transformation in the medium term,” he added. Mr. Balisacan cited the need to make economic growth more inclusive amid improving poverty statistics in recent years. “We must enhance access to high-quality employment and market opportunities and strengthen social protection, reduce poverty to single-digit levels and improve the overall quality of life,” he said. The economy grew by 5.7% in the first quarter, slower than expected and below the state’s 6-7% target for the year. ‘SYNERGY’George I. Royeca, chief executive officer of motorcycle ride-hailing mobile app Angkas, said informal workers have a lot to contribute to the economy. “The challenge for us is how to create a platform for informal workers, how to provide financial services and raise financial literacy,” he told the forum. “I really hope that we can push the informal sector and make it really thrive.” He added that the country should adopt innovative strategies in various industries. Globe Telecom, Inc. Vice-President Emmanuel L. Estrada said there’s a need to bridge the digital divide. “Digital connectivity has now become fundamental to economic progress,” he said at the forum. “We need not just connectivity, but universal and meaningful connectivity.” Jesus C. Romero, chief operations officer and senior executive vice-president at Converge ICT Solutions, Inc., said the local broadband industry still has a lot of work to do in boosting capacity and cutting costs. “There is no one-size-fits-all internet for all situations,” he told the forum. “There will be people who are better off with mobile and those who are better off with fiber broadband.” Miguel G. Belmonte, president and CEO at BusinessWorld Publishing Corp., said public-private coordination is needed to attract investments and create more jobs. “Among these growth drivers, what stands out to me is the inspiring synergy between the government and the private sector, which is a major driving force for the country in spurring investment, innovation and job creation,” he said. “The private sector employs over 60% of the labor force and contributes a large chunk to Philippine GDP,” Mr. Belmonte said. “With critical industries like energy, telecommunications and infrastructure having given a huge potential to the private sector, the possibilities for the country are truly marvelous.”",https://www.bworldonline.com/top-stories/2024/05/23/596917/education-manufacturing-and-tourism-are-key-growth-drivers-says-jg-summit-ceo/
