Senate will ‘balance’  relationship with House  on Cha-cha issue – Chiz,Raymond Africa,"May 23, 2024","SENATE President Francis “Chiz” Escudero yesterday said that his position against amending the 1987 Constitution has not changed despite his election as leader of the upper chamber.,But, Escudero told reporters that the Senate will have to “balance our relationship” with the House of Representatives, which is pushing for the revision of the Charter’s so-called restrictive economic provisions, so the two chambers will not end up as “enemies.”,Escudero said while his stance against Charter change is shared by most senators, “but at the same time we have to balance our relationship with the House.”,“Meaning aayusin naman natin. We can agree to disagree but not at each other’s necks, nose na mag-a-away… hindi naman kailangan mag-agree sa lahat ng bagay para hindi maghiwalay. Puwede naman magkasundo sa maraming bagay. Puwedeng hindi magkasundo nang hindi nag-aaway (This means that we will fix it. We can agree to disagree but not at each other’s necks, nose that we will resort to fighting… we do not need to agree on all things to remain united. [But] We can agree on several matters. We can also disagree without fighting),” he said in a chance interview at the Senate.,Former Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri has earlier said that at least eight senators, including Escudero, are against Cha-cha, which prompted Senate minority leader Aquilino Pimentel III to say that proposed Resolution of Both Houses No. 6 (RBH 6), or the economic Cha-cha bill, has no chance of being approved in the Senate.,RBH 7, the House’s counterpart version of RBH 6, has already been approved by the lower chamber and transmitted to the Senate for the latter’s approval.,In a press conference after his resignation as Senate president, Zubiri has said that “Cha-cha is dead in the Senate” since Escudero is not keen on the proposal.,Escudero said that since Sen. Juan Edgardo Angara has resigned as chairperson of the subcommittee of the Committee on Constitutional Reforms which is discussing RBH 6, all scheduled hearings of the panel will now be deferred. The subcommittee was scheduled to hold the last two hearings on RBH 6 in Cebu and Cagayan de Oro cities this week.,Escudero said Cha-cha was not discussed during the dinner Tuesday night hosted by President Marcos Jr. and First Lady Liza Araneta for senators and their spouses.,“Hindi namin napag-usapan, wala kaming napag usapan (We did not talk about it, we did not talk about it),” he said.,Escudero said Tuesday night’s dinner in Malacañang was scheduled three weeks ago, as he dismissed speculations that the ouster of Zubiri was initiated supposedly on the prodding of the First Lady, who was reportedly irked with the Senate’s investigation on the President’s alleged use of illegal drugs in 2012 when he was still a senator.,“Quite frankly, it (change of leadership) was not discussed. I was not asked. All he (referring to Marcos) said… he was in Dumaguete and Bacolod and by the time he landed, he was informed [about the leadership change], by the time he landed, he found out that there was already a change and it was finished. That’s what he told me… He never knew about it…, ” Escudero said,The Senate leader said he was absent during the last two dinners hosted by the President, and was compelled to attend Tuesday night since he is now the Senate president.,Escudero said the spouses of the senators were also invited to attend the dinner with the First Couple.,Mrs. Marcos, in an Instagram post, said she and the President “had a nice time breaking bread with the senators and their spouses.”,In a separate Facebook post, she described the gathering as a “casual dinner.”,A photo taken during the event showed that among the senators who were present Escudero and his wife Heart Evangelista, Senate president pro tempore Jinggoy Estrada, Senate majority leader Francis Tolentino, and Senators Grace Poe, Cynthia Villar, Loren Legarda, Pia Cayetano, Alan Peter Cayetano, Robinhood Padilla, Raffy Tulfo, Mark Villar, and Sherwin Gatchalian.,Aside from Evangelista, the other spouses who joined the dinner were ACT-CIS party-list Rep. Jocelyn Tulfo; former Senate President Manny Villar; Emmeline Yan Aglipay (wife of Mark Villar), Cavite Rep. Lani Mercado-Revilla, and Kathryna Yu-Pimentel, wife of Sen. Aquilino Pimentel III.,Senators Pimentel and Bong Revilla did not attend the gathering.,Absent during the dinner were Senators Zubiri, Angara, Nancy Binay, Joseph Victor “JV” Ejercito, Joel Villanueva, Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa, Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go, Lito Lapid, Risa Hontiveros, and Imee Marcos.,Former Senate President Franklin Drilon, in an interview with ANC, said it cannot be denied that Malacañang has something to do with the change of leadership in the Senate.,“But having said that, to me, there’s nothing wrong with it because the President is the political leader of our country. And therefore, as President, he has the prerogative and the obligation to make sure that his policies find its way in the law books,” Drilon said.,“Ang you can only push this policy if the leaders of both houses themselves align to the same policy. So, there is nothing, I must emphasize, that the political leader of this country will try to influence the leadership in both chambers,” he added.,To his opinion, Drilon said Zubiri was ousted due to the “cumulative effect” of a number of political events which started when the People’s Initiative backed by the House of Representatives became a hot issue.,He said another issue was when Zubiri approved the issuance if an arrest order against Kingdom of Jesus Christ leader Pastor Quiboloy, who is a known ally of then President Duterte.,The final event was when the Senate Committee on Public Order held its hearings on the “PDEA leaks.”,During yesterday’s session, Zubiri was named as the new chair of the Committee on Economic Affairs, replacing Sen. Mark Villar who was elected as the new chair of the Committee on Government Corporations and Public Enterprises vice Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano.,Cayetano was elected chair of the Committee on Trade and Industry and the Committee on Higher, Technical, and Vocational Education, which was previously chaired by Escudero.,Senators also elected Sen Pia Cayetano as chairperson of the Committee on Energy, Sen. Raffy Tulfo of the Committee on Public Services, Sen. Grace Poe of the Committee on Finance, Majority leader Francis Tolentino of the Committee on Justice and Human Rights and of the Committee on Ethics, Sen.

Imee Marcos of the Committee on Urban Planning, Housing, and Resettlement.,Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian was retained as chair of the Committee on Basic Education and Committee on Ways and Means, while Sen. Joseph Victor Ejercito was re-elected as chair of the Committee on Local Government. ",https://malaya.com.ph/news_news/senate-will-balance-relationship-with-house-on-cha-cha-issue-chiz/
Israel allows return to three evacuated West Bank settlements,Reuters,"May 23, 2024","JERUSALEM — The Israeli military has approved permission for Israelis to return to three former West Bank settlements they had been banned from entering since an evacuation ordered in 2005, the defence ministry said on Wednesday.,The three settlements, Sa-nur, Ganim and Kadim, are located near the Palestinian cities of Jenin and Nablus, both of which are strongholds of armed militant groups in the northern West Bank.,A fourth settlement, Homesh, was cleared for entry last year after parliament passed an amendment to the so-called “disengagement law” of 2005. Permission from the military, which has overall control of the West Bank, was required for any return to the other three former settlements.,The military announced the move on the day three European states said they would formally recognize the State of Palestine, and as Israel’s military offensive against the Palestinian militant group Hamas continued in the Gaza Strip.,It took the decision despite international pressure on Israel to curb settlement expansion in the West Bank, which Palestinians want as the core of a future independent state alongside Gaza.,“The Jewish hold on Judea and Samaria guarantees security, the application of the law to cancel disengagement will lead to the development of settlement and provide security to residents of the area,” Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said in a statement, using the Biblical names for the West Bank that are often used in Israel.,There was no immediate comment from the Palestinian Authority.,Last year’s amendment to the disengagement law was seen as opening the way to re-establishing former West Bank settlements evacuated in 2005 under a plan overseen by former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.,Under the plan, which was opposed by the settler movement at the time, all 21 Israeli settlements in Gaza were ordered to be evacuated. Most settlements in the West Bank were unaffected apart from the four that will now be accessible again.,More than 500,000 Jewish settlers are now estimated to be living in the West Bank, part of territory captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, with a further 200,000 living in East Jerusalem.,For Palestinians and most of the international community, the settlements are considered illegal. Israel disputes this, citing the Jewish people’s historical, biblical and political links to the area as well as security considerations.,Despite international opposition, settlements have continued to expand strongly under successive Israeli governments.",https://malaya.com.ph/news_news/israel-allows-return-to-three-evacuated-west-bank-settlements/

"Ireland, Spain, Norway announce recognition of Palestinian state",Reuters,"May 23, 2024","DUBLIN/OSLO/MADRID — Ireland, Spain and Norway announced on Wednesday that they would recognize a Palestinian state on May 28, saying they hoped other Western countries would follow suit, prompting Israel to recall its ambassadors.,Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the move was aimed at accelerating efforts to secure a ceasefire in Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza.,“We hope that our recognition and our reasons contribute to other western countries to follow this path, because the more we are, the more strength we will have to impose a ceasefire, to achieve the release of the hostages held by Hamas, to relaunch the political process that can lead to a peace agreement,” he said in a speech to the country’s lower house.,Ireland’s Prime Minister Simon Harris announced the decision at a news conference in Dublin. He added that Ireland was unequivocal in recognizing Israel’s right to exist “securely and in peace with its neighbors”, and calling for all hostages in Gaza to be immediately returned.,In Oslo, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said the only possible political solution between Israelis and Palestinians is “two states living side by side in peace and security”.,Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz ordered the immediate return of the Israeli ambassadors from the three countries for consultations, and warned of further “severe consequences”.,“I am sending a clear message today: Israel will not be complacent against those who undermine its sovereignty and endanger its security,” he said.,The decision was welcomed by the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self rule in the Israeli occupied West Bank, and by Hamas, which has ruled the Gaza Strip since driving the PA out of the enclave in 2007.,Around 144 out of 193 member-states of the United Nations recognize Palestine as a state, including most of the global south, Russia, China and India. But only a handful of the 27 EU members have done so so far, mostly former Communist countries as well as Sweden and Cyprus.,Britain, Australia and EU member Malta have indicated in recent months that they could soon follow suit.,Recognition of a Palestinian state is still opposed for now by Israel’s closest ally the United States, which has the power to veto it at the United Nations and did so last month.,Washington says it favors Palestinian statehood eventually, but only as a result of negotiations with Israel, a position it shares with European powers including France and Germany. No negotiations over Palestinian statehood have taken place since the last round of talks collapsed a decade ago.,Israel launched its war in Gaza in retaliation for an Oct. 7 assault by Hamas in which fighters killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages, by Israeli tallies. Israel’s operations in the enclave have killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry.,Israel says recognizing Palestinian statehood now would effectively reward Hamas for its attacks.,Spain and its allies have spent months lobbying European nations, including France, Portugal, Belgium and Slovenia, to garner support for the recognition of a Palestinian state.,Eamon Ryan, head of one of the Irish government’s three coalition parties, told RTE radio that Ireland already has a Palestinian ambassador and the recognition “is changing the nature of the embassy that Palestine has in our state… to give it full diplomatic rights and accreditation and that is something that will happen quite quickly.”,He said the recognition was timed to support efforts by countries including Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia to achieve a ceasefire and broader peace deal.,Israel’s foreign ministry said it would reprimand the Irish, Spanish and Norwegian ambassadors and show them a video of female hostages being held in captivity by Hamas.,Palestinians seek statehood in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as their capital.",https://malaya.com.ph/news_news/ireland-spain-norway-announce-recognition-of-palestinian-state/

Both options will end on March 31, 2025.,She said the DepEd discussed the proposed school calendars with teachers, school officials, and parents.,The current school year is set to end on May 31.,The Teachers Dignity Coalition welcomed Marcos’ decision, saying although it does not jive with its proposal that classes end on April 11 next year, the new schedule is fine with the group.,The President, who prefers not to conduct classes on Saturdays, felt the 167-day school calendar was “too short” and significantly reduces the number of school days and contact time between teachers and learners which may compromise learning outcomes.,The Presidential Communications Office (PCO) said Marcos “did not want students going to school on Saturdays” to complete the 182-day school calendar as it could jeopardize the well-being of students and demand more resources.,As a “compromise,” the PCO said the President opted to extend the school year until April with no Saturday classes to complete the 182 school calendar days, instead of ending the school year on March 31, 2025.,“Let us prolong the school days. Let’s just add more school days so we do not touch the Saturdays. So, the school day will remain the same.

How Trump’s hush money trial verdict could affect the 2024 election,Reuters,"May 23, 2024","WASHINGTON. – Jurors hearing the first-ever criminal trial of a former US president could render their verdict in Donald Trump’s hush money case as soon as next week, with potentially big implications for the 2024 White House race.,Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a payment that bought the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election. Daniels had threatened to go public with her account of an alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, a liaison he denies.,The New York case is widely seen as the least consequential of the four criminal prosecutions Trump faces. But it has meant the Republican presidential candidate spent more time in court than campaigning in recent weeks, and brought outsized attention to the only case likely to go to trial before his Nov. 5 election face-off with Democratic President Joe Biden.,Here’s how three potential outcomes from the jury room — a guilty verdict, an acquittal or a hung jury — could affect the presidential campaign.,Opinion polls show a guilty verdict could pose significant political danger for Trump in an election that will potentially be decided by just tens of thousands of votes in a handful of battleground states.,One in four Republicans said they would not vote for Trump if he is found guilty in a criminal trial, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll of registered voters in April. In the same survey, 60% of independents said they would not vote for Trump if he is convicted of a crime.,Republican and Democratic consultants have mixed views about the impact of a guilty verdict.,Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, doubts that as many as a fourth of Republicans would actually shun Trump if he’s convicted. But Ayres said even if just a small number of more moderate Republicans and independents are turned off by a guilty verdict, it could help Biden in a close election.,However, Ayres said the nature of the New York case, which was brought by a Democratic prosecutor and relies on untested legal strategies, will help Trump and fellow Republicans frame a guilty verdict as a political hit job.,“If I were trying to design a court case that would be easy for Republicans to dismiss as a partisan witch hunt, I would design exactly the case that’s being brought in New York,” Ayres said.,Republican consultant Tricia McLaughlin, who worked on former Trump primary challenger Vivek Ramaswamy’s campaign, said she thought a guilty verdict would have a psychological impact on Trump because he hates losing. It would also divert more financial resources to legal bills because he would be almost certain to appeal a guilty verdict, she added.,Bill Galston, an analyst and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, said he didn’t expect a guilty verdict would have a significant impact on the presidential race.,“In the end, this amounts to lying about sex. I think the view probably of the majority of Americans is that everybody lies about sex,” said Galston, who has worked on Democratic presidential campaigns.,He also served in the administration of President Bill Clinton, whose 1990s tenure in the White House was marked by sex scandals.,Consultants from across the political spectrum agree on one thing: An acquittal would be a huge victory for Trump, especially because he has claimed the trial is a sham political persecution aimed at derailing his presidential bid.,On the campaign trail, the candidate could use a not-guilty verdict in New York to claim the other cases against him also have no legal merit, McLaughlin said.,Trump faces federal and state charges in Washington and Georgia of trying to overturn his 2020 loss to Biden and federal charges in Florida of mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House in 2021.

D. diseases,” said Domingo, explaining that the “W” refers to water-borne diseases, such as food poisoning and gastroenteritis, which are caused b by contaminated water.,“This can be prevented if we will boil our water if we are unsure of its safety,” said Domingo.,The “I,” he refers to influenza-like illnesses, which include coronavirus disease (COVID-19), cough, and colds. “Because of the changing weather, the linings of our noses and throats get irritated,” he said.,Domingo said the public must be vigilant against the “L,” or leptospirosis, which is caused by the bacteria from animal urine commonly found in floods.,“As much as possible, don’t wade in flood water. But when it is not avoided, immediately wash your feet and body after wading in the flood,” he said.,Lastly, the DOH said the public must be on guard against “D,” which stands for dengue, which is caused by the aedes aegypti mosquitoes.,“If there are any potential breeding sites, we should prevent the accumulation of water so that they won’t breed mosquitoes that would eventually bring dengue,” said Domingo.,Earlier, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said the La Niña may be felt in the country between June and August of this year.",https://malaya.com.ph/news_news/public-alerted-on-w-i-l-d-diseases/
SMB nears Big Dance,Michael Jugado,"May 23, 2024","REIGNING seven-time MVP June Mar Fajardo of San Miguel Beer missed an inside attempt just when Rain or Shine was desperately mounting a comeback last night.,But Beerman Don Trollano came out of nowhere, collared the offensive rebound, and scored on a putback that stifled the Elasto Painters’ hopes—to the delight of the big crowd.,Flexing its potent firepower anew, SMB prevailed 117-107 in Game 3 of their best-of-7 semifinals showdown in the PBA Philippine Cup at the City of Dasmariñas Arena in Cavite.,Trollano’s layup that left the Painters bewildered gave the Beermen some breathing room—a 101-97 cushion with 5:41 to go—before Marcio Lassiter banged in a backbreaking three-pointer that made it a 112-95 game, only 1:12 left.,SMB coach Jorge Gallent pointed to his charges’ resolve that saved them from what could have been a huge meltdown and gave them a commanding 3-0 lead in the race-to-4 series.,The Beermen also proved they can hack it despite Fajardo only winding up with 11 points although he did grab 11 rebounds.,“The boys we’re really composed especially in the last five minutes when Rain or Shine threatened. It’s just composure and we knew where to go in the endgame,” Gallent said.,“Fortunately, Terrence (Romeo) and Don’s shots went in so that’s a good sign for us.,“June Mar had his shots. He had open shots that just didn’t go in. He just has to practice more on that, but his effort was there. He has to do a lot of things—he has to score and defend the opponent’s big men,” he added.,CJ Perez shone with 23 points, 14 boards, and four assists for SMB while Lassiter knocked down five triples and wound up with 21 markers and four caroms.,Trollano, Terrence Romeo, Chris Ross, and Mo Tautuaa also had 20, 13, 12, and 10 points, respectively, as the Beermen did an encore to a 106-89 win in the second tiff last Sunday.,SMB goes for a semis sweep in Game 4 tomorrow at the Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay.,The Beermen took a 51-47 lead at the half and padded it to as much as 86-75 in the third canto before settling for a 91-85 edge entering the payoff period.,Fiery Rain or Shine tactician Yeng Guiao charged at Romeo at the buzzer after the latter took and made a trey that pegged the final count with the outcome of the game already decided.,An exchange of expletives was heard between Guiao and Romeo before cooler heads intervened.,Beau Belga paced the Painters with 19 points and seven rebounds while Adrian Nocum, Keith Datu, and Jhonard Clarito all added 14 markers each.",https://malaya.com.ph/news_sports/smb-nears-big-dance/

Last-hole birdie lifts Bisera past Kim,...,"May 23, 2024","FLORENCE Bisera endured challenging bounces off the tee with a near-impeccable short game, pounding out a gutsy two-under 70 to take a one-stroke lead over Seoyun Kim yesterday as the ICTSI Ladies Philippine Masters got going at the Villamor Golf Club.,Following her maiden victory at home in South Pacific in Davao last September, Bisera navigated the tight layout virtually unscathed. She overcame a bogey on No. 16 with three birdies, including a tap-in on the final hole.,“Actually, my driving was good, but I missed many shots due to the unpredictable kicks.,However, my short game, especially putting, was strong,” said Bisera. She birdied the par-3 No. 4 and No. 15 but couldn’t save par after missing the green on the next hole.,She hinted at adjusting her strategy for the second round, saying: “I might avoid using the driver too much, the fairways are very unpredictable.”,The impressive finish distanced her from Kim, who began her round at the backside and reached the ninth hole at two-under par with four birdies against two bogeys. But she struggled with her putting, missing close-range birdie opportunities on Nos. 6 and 7 and failing to get up-and-down on the last hole, resulting in a 71.,“It was not my day. My driver was all over the place, but my irons were fine. In times of trouble, I managed to save par,” said Kim, motivated by her family’s support. “They trust me so much. That’s why I want to do well this week and I believe I can.”,Defending champion Harmie Constantino, who had a rough start, rebounded with a blistering windup. From joint seventh at three-over after 15 holes, the back-to-back winner at Palos Verdes and Caliraya Springs birdied two of the last three holes to card a 73 and solo third.,Pre-tournament favorite Pauline del Rosario also demonstrated her prowess, bucking an early mishap on No. 2 with three birdies over the next 11 holes. But an uncharacteristic quadruple bogey on the par-4 No. 14 derailed her charge. She bogeyed the next hole but birdied the 16th, finishing with a 74.",https://malaya.com.ph/news_sports/last-hole-birdie-lifts-bisera-past-kim/

‘Vaping proven less harmful than smoking’,___,"May 23, 2024","VAPING has been proven significantly less harmful than smoking cigarettes, based on numerous scientific evidence in the United Kingdom.,In a statement, the UK Vaping Industry Association cited evidence saying that “while vaping is not entirely risk-free, it is significantly less harmful than smoking – which claims around 80,000 lives every year in the UK alone.”,The UKVIA issued the comments after the vaping industry and vapers were excluded from discussions during the committee stage of the Tobacco and Vapes Bill in the UK Parliament.,It said the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID) maintains that “vapes are at least 95% less harmful than cigarettes.”  The UKVIA adds that vaping poses a “small fraction of the risks of smoking” and that “completely switching from smoking to vaping conveys substantial health benefits over continued smoking.”,England’s Chief Medical Officer, Sir Chris Whitty, acknowledged that vaping is “much safer” than smoking, calling the switch a “positive health move,” the UKVIA said.,Research conducted by Brunel University London concluded that the National Health Service “could save more than half a billion pounds per year if just half of England’s adult smokers switched to vaping,” the report added.,A 2019 investigation into reports of vaping causing lung illness in the US found that the cases stemmed from contaminated, illegal products containing THC, the psychoactive component in cannabis, not legal nicotine vaping products.,Alice Davies, a health information officer at Cancer Research UK, said “headlines could be misleading as these cases were due to contaminants in illegal products and not linked to regular nicotine vaping.,“There was no similar outbreak in the UK and the chemicals of concern are banned in the UK.”,The OHID Nicotine Vaping in England: Evidence Update said there were “lessons to be learned from the mislabeled US EVALI (electronic cigarette or vape associated lung injury) outbreak’ and that communications about EVALI should clearly separate vaping these illicit substances from nicotine vaping.,Cancer Research UK confirmed that “there have been no confirmed cases of popcorn lung reported in people who use e-cigarettes” and that vapes don’t cause lung injury.,The UKVIA also cited the latest data from Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), a public health charity, showing that “almost 4.5 million adults in Great Britain have used vaping to cut down on or completely stop smoking.”,The National Health Service (NHS) considers vaping “one of the most effective tools for quitting smoking,” while the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities reports that vaping products “remain the most common aid used by people to help them quit.”,James Tucker, head of health analysis at the Office for National Statistics (ONS), was quoted as saying that “vaping has played a ‘major role’ in reducing smoking rates across the UK…which are now at a record low.”,A comprehensive analysis by Cochrane, a global independent network of researchers in health, which looked at data from over 300 clinical trials involving more than 150,000 people, reveals that e-cigarettes are among the most effective aids available to help adult smokers quit.,The UKVIA also denied a link between regular vaping and taking up smoking.,They cited an ASH UK dossier called “Addressing Common Myths About Vaping,” reviewed by leading scientists, which showed vaping is not a “proven gateway into smoking.”,The dossier found that as e-cigarette use rose in England between 2010 and 2021, smoking rates among young people “continued to fall at least as rapidly as previously.” ASH UK said this “does not support the gateway hypothesis at a population level.”",https://malaya.com.ph/news_news/vaping-proven-less-harmful-than-smoking/
"Ukraine equips naval drones with rocket launchers, Kyiv source says",Reuters,"May 23, 2024","KYIV — Ukraine has equipped some of its naval drones with multiple rocket launching systems and used them to fire at Russian positions in combat, a Ukrainian intelligence source told Reuters on Wednesday.,Ukraine, which no longer has any significant warships in its fleet, has used uncrewed naval drones packed with explosives to sail up to Russian warships in the Black Sea, detonating on impact.,The systems have played a part in Kyiv’s effort to push back Russian naval vessels from areas of the Black Sea used by commercial vessels to ship Ukrainian exports.,The Ukrainian source, who declined to be named, said some “Sea Babies”, a model of naval drone used by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), had been equipped with Grad multiple rocket launching systems.,“Today, we can confirm that they (the drones) are equipped with a multiple rocket launch system, and this technological solution is already showing powerful results.”,The source said the modified drones had been used to attack Russian positions on the Kinburn Spit in Ukraine’s southern region of Mykolaiv this week.,Reuters could not independently verify the use of the modified weapons.,Russian forces occupied the strip of land in the first year of their full-scale invasion in February 2022.",https://malaya.com.ph/news_news/ukraine-equips-naval-drones-with-rocket-launchers-kyiv-source-says/
House energy panel vice chair lists grounds to reject Meralco franchise renewal,___,"May 23, 2024","REP. Dan Fernandez has listed what he said were grounds to reject the renewal of Meralco’s franchise, including the utility’s failure to provide updates on its weighted average cost of capital (WACC), a key factor that determines power rates.,Fernandez, House energy committee vice chair, said under the law that granted the Meralco franchise—RA 9209–the utility giant is required to submit every four years a report on its WACC. The Meralco WACC has remained at 14.97 percent since 2010.,Fernandez said to hit the WACC target of Meralco, power rates have to move upwards and stay high.,He said Meralco’s 14.97 percent WACC set in 2010 was no longer accurate.,Consumers, he said, are burdened by power rates that are among the highest in the world because of Meralco’s WACC, which had been approved by the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC).,“Basically, the problem we have seen is there’s a collusion between ERC and Meralco during the time of ERC chair Agnes Devanadera,” Fernandez said, adding he found six cases that the ERC approved at that time which allowed Meralco to adjust its maximum average price.,“This is where the wrong WACC of 14.97 percent is based,” Fernandez said.,He said the WACC should have been just 8.27 percent so a rate of P1.35 being charged to consumers should be lower.,He said the ERC failed to fulfill its mandate to provide the least cost possible to consumers by allowing Meralco to adjust rates almost at will.,“The function of ERC is to regulate and this is being abused and not complied with. Why?” he lamented. “ERC must protect consumers. Meralco must provide electricity at the very least cost. But it’s not being done.”,He decried the ERC failure to exercise its moral obligation to require Meralco to adjust its WACC.,“I think they have the moral obligation to compel Meralco, knowing that it’s much, much lower than 14.97,” he said.,For these reasons, he said instead of renewing the Meralco franchise, it should be split into three “to allow real competition.”",https://malaya.com.ph/news_news/house-energy-panel-vice-chair-lists-grounds-to-reject-meralco-franchise-renewal/
‘Ayungin Shoal status quo deal made in 2013’,Wendell Vigilia,"May 22, 2024","FORMER Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea yesterday denied former President Rodrigo Duterte forged a “secret deal” with Chinese President Xi Jinping, under which the Philippines will refrain from repairing the warship BRP Sierra Madre that was grounded at the Ayungin Shoal in the West Philippine Sea (WPS) to serve as a military outpost.,Medialdea, at the continuation of the joint hearing of the House committee on national defense and the special committee on the West Philippine Sea, also said the commitment to maintain the status quo began in 2013 under the Aquino administration.,Medialdea said that based on the information he gathered after assuming the post in 2016, the status quo at the Ayungin Shoal “was in a 2013 commitment of former Defense Secretary (Voltaire) Gazmin to the Chinese Ambassador Ma Keqing that he would only deliver food,and water to the marines stationed at the vessel.”,
The joint panel hearing later approved a motion of Rep. France Castro (PL, ACT) to invite Gazmin to the next hearing.,Lawmakers have also invited former Duterte spokesman Harry Roque who was the first to claim Duterte and Chinese President Xi Jinping forged the secret deal, or “gentleman’s agreement, covering supply missions for soldiers stationed at the BRP Sierra Madre.,Medialdea said he attended two Duterte-Xi meetings, first was Xi’s state visit to the Philippines in November 2018, and Duterte’s official visit to China in August 2019, “and no gentleman’s agreement ever took place between President Duterte and President Xi.”,
“President Duterte, being a lawyer, knew fully well that it was foolhardy to enter into an agreement, especially a gentleman’s agreement at that, with the President of the People’s Republic of China on matters involving sovereign rights,” he told the joint panel.,Medialdea said Duterte and Xi had eight official meetings between October 2016 and August 2019 and the former president was always accompanied by his incumbent foreign affairs secretaries, the late secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr., then acting secretary now Secretary Enrique Manalo; secretary, now Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano; and secretary, now Ambassador to the United Kingdom Teodoro Locsin Jr.,The alleged secret deal that only food and water would be delivered to troops stationed at Ayungin Shoal meant that BRP Sierra Madre, which has been serving as the Philippine military’s outpost since 1999, will eventually crumble, endangering the Philippines’ claim over the area.,Duterte’s Former Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana and his former National Security Adviser Hermogenes Esperon also attended the hearing after skipping it last Monday because of prior commitments.,Medialdea told Rep. Ramon Rodrigo Gutierrez (PL, 1-Rider) said he got the information that Gazmin and Ma were responsible for the Ayungin Shoal deal during the first several days of the Duterte administration, when it was preparing for the July 12, 2016 Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) decision which awarded the arbitral victory to the Philippines.,“I cannot elaborate (on) it particularly on the status, that’s what I gathered when the decision came out 12 days after we assumed office, I was asking around what is the present status at Ayungin Shoal because I know there was a vessel there, and the information I gathered was that there was a previous commitment that food and water will be allowed to be shipped to the dilapidated vessel since 2013,” he said.,“I got that source from one of the officials before, I cannot recall (who), it was an off-the-cuff query when the decision was about to come out, ‘Ano bang status diyan (What is the status there)?’ That was it,” Medialdea added.,DFA UNAWARE,A representative of the Department of Foreign Affairs told the hearing the department was unaware of any 2013 commitment.,In May 2013, China opposed the Philippines’ reported plan to establish structures on Ayungin Shoal, during a brief meeting between Gazmin and Ma on the sidelines of the commemoration of the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers at Camp Aguinaldo.,In 2014, Gazmin told a Senate budget hearing that the Philippine Navy was able to conduct resupply missions to Ayungin Shoal without being harassed by Chinese maritime surveillance vessels.,Lorenzana said he was unaware of Gazmin’s alleged deal with Ma because he “transmitted no such thing to me when he briefed me.” He said despite Duterte’s status quo policy on Ayungin, the Philippine Navy started repairing “our soldiers housing quarters in BRP Sierra Madre in Ayungin to make them comfortable.”,“That’s when the Chinese Coast Guard started blasting us with their water cannons. They thought we were trying to strengthen BRP Sierra Madre,” Lorenzana told lawmakers.,Lorenzana said he attended almost all of the Duterte-Xi meetings between 2016 and 2019 and “it was very telling that, at their last meeting in 2019, President Duterte asserted in front of everybody in the bilateral meeting, that he’s asserting the rights of the Philippines over the (WPS), on the basis of the UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) in the arbitral ruling.”,He said Xi told Duterte that China also claims the area and that “we cannot resolve this matter within our lifetime, but maybe our children and grandchildren will be smart enough to find a solution.”,Last March 27, Roque confirmed the secret pact when asked to comment on China’s aggression whenever the Philippines try to conduct resupply missions for troops at the BRP Sierra Madre. He said then China may have been acting that way as the Philippines was no longer honoring the agreement, which, he admitted, was non-binding.,Duterte, who initially denied that there was such a pact, later admitted that he and Xi had an agreement to maintain the status quo in the WPS to keep the peace in the area and avoid any conflict. He said the agreement meant that there will be “no movement, no armed patrols.”,NO ACTION,Gonzales said assuming the Gazmin promise really existed, the fact remained that Duterte did not disturb the status quo even after the Philippines won the arbitration case.,“The arbitral court declared that Ayungin was ours, that we have sovereign rights over that area. We could have done what we wanted to do there – in fact, we could do anything – but we did not,” he said.,Gutierrez also said the Duterte administration’s decision to preserve the status quo from 2016 to 2022 came as a “shocking surprise” to him because less than a month into office, the former president was already aware of the country’s arbitral victory over disputed areas in the West Philippine Sea, including Scarborough Shoal, Mischief Reef and Ayungin Shoal.,Gutierrez informed his colleagues and the committees’ resource persons that he searched the internet and found that the alleged Gazmin promise did not exist.,Castro said the statements of Medialdea, Lorenzana and Esperon that no gentleman’s agreement was made on Ayungin Shoal “prove that all those assertions by China that such an agreement existed are all lies.”,The two panels later suspended the hearing and opted to hold a closed-door session to listen to testimonies on issues bordering on national security.,TRESPASS ISSUE,Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo yesterday said China’s policy empowering its coast guard to detain foreign nationals supposedly trespassing in the South China Sea is inconsistent with the United Nation Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS).,“We have to see what will happen but obviously whatever they said, if that’s correct, is inconsistent with UNCLOS,” Manalo said in an ambush interview on the sidelines of the Indo-Pacific Business Forum at the Shangri-la the Fort in Taguig City.,He did not elaborate.,Manalo was asked to comment on the remarks of China that the Philippines had a malicious misinterpretation of its new regulations in the SCS.,“When they announced it, it was quite clear, so, I mean, what’s malicious to it,” Manalo said.,President Marcos Jr. has said China’s new policy is “completely unacceptable to the Philippines.”,The Chinese government said that starting June, the China Coast Guard could detain trespassers in the South China Sea for up to 60 days.,China, which is claiming most of the South China Sea, has overlapping claims with several nations — the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, and Malaysia and Taiwan.,In the past months, tension between the Philippines and China had escalated after the latter started using water cannons against Filipino vessels that were delivering food and supplies to an old Navy ship at the Ayungin Shoal. China had also been blocking and harassing Filipino vessels and fishing boats at the Scarborough Shoal area.,CHINESE VESSELS,The Armed Forces has monitored 128 Chinese vessels in Scarborough Shoal and in Philippine-occupied features in the West Philippine Sea from May 14 to 20.,The number increased by 30, from just 98 Chinese vessels that were monitored in the previous week.,Data provided by the Navy showed 108 of the 128 vessels monitored from May 14 to 20 are Chinese maritime vessels, 14 are Chinese Coast Guard vessels, and six Chinese Navy ships.,Fifty-five of the 128 vessels were sighted at Scarborough Shoal — 42 maritime vessels, nine Coast Guard vessels and four Navy vessels during the previous. There were only 28 Chinese vessels in the area in the previous week.,The Atin Ito coalition embarked on a voyage to the shoal last week to distribute food packs and fuel to Filipino fishermen in the area. This prompted China to deploy a large number of vessels, officials earlier said.,China gained control of the shoal in 2012 after a standoff with Philippine government vessels. China has prevented Filipino fishermen from going inside the shoal’s lagoon since then.,At the Philippine-occupied Pag-asa Island, there were 27 Chinese maritime militia vessels, two Chinese Navy vessels and a Chinese Coast Guard vessel in the area from May 14 to 20.,There were 25 Chinese maritime vessels and four Chinese Coast Guard vessels seen in Ayungin Shoal during the same period.,Fourteen other Chinese maritime vessels were sighted at five other — seven at Panata Island, three at Patag island, two at Lawak Island, and one each at Kota and Likas islands.

"News Highlights: May 23, 2024",___,"May 23, 2024","TEN victims of human trafficking in Laguna, including seven who were rescued from “commercial sexual exploitation” activities, were rescued and are now under the custody of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD).,Social Welfare assistant secretary Irene Dumlao said the 10 “victim-survivors of human trafficking” who were rescued during operations in Biñan and Calamba in Laguna last May 10 and 16 are currently being provided immediate protection and support by the DSWD Field Office in the Calabarzon.,Dumlao said the victim-survivors were provided with psychosocial counseling and referral support for temporary shelter placement.,She said the DSWD is also helping the victims-survivors with their rehabilitation and eventual reintegration into their respective communities.,Dumlao said three of the victims are minors who were victims-survivors of Online Sexual Abuse or Exploitation of Children (OSAEC) and Child Sexual Abuse or Exploitation Materials (CSAEM), while the seven others were rescued from commercial sexual exploitation.,“The DSWD, as the co-chair of the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking (IACAT), condemns this kind of activity. We urge the public to report any human trafficking and sexual exploitation. Let us break the ‘no touch, no harm’ mentality. OSAEC and CSAEM is a form of violence against children and punishable crime under the law,” she said.,Dumalo said the rescue operations were conducted with the help of the National Bureau of Investigation’s (NBI) Anti-Human Trafficking Division.,She said DSWD is also closely coordinating with the Philippine National Police (PNP) to track and apprehend the perpetrators of such crimes and rescue the victims.,As this developed the DSWD Secretary Rex Gatchalian, during the 1st National Congress on Adoption and Alternative Child Care held at the Rizal Park Hotel in Manila yesterday, reiterated his call for a stop on the illegal online sale of babies and illegal adoption of children.,Gatcahlian reiterated that the sale of children is the cruelest form of human trafficking.,NACC executive director Undersecretary Janella Estrada, in an interview with Bagong Pilipinas, said babies sold online can fetch a price between P10,000 to P100,000.,She said the eight-day old baby boy rescued last week in Cavite was sold for P90,000 with the P50,000 going to the mother and the P40,000 to the person that facilitated the online sale.,Gatchalian said the process of adoption in the country is now simpler and the DSWD, along with its attached agency, the National Authority for Child Care (NACC), is in the process of creating a digital system to make the adoption and alternative child care process in the country more innovative and responsive to children in need of alternative child care.,“We want to create an ecosystem or a network of care facilities nationwide, all tucked in the NACC database so that when a prospective adoptive parent in the Philippines or abroad wants to adopt, all our care facilities are linked into them,” Gatchalian said.,He said the system will help address the issue of child trafficking in social media platforms since all child care facilities and the services they offer, whether privately-run, national government-run, or local government-run, will be linked to the database handled by the NACC,CAGAYAN de Oro City Rep. Rufus Rodriguez yesterday urged the Commission on Election (Comelec) to consider the proposal of Smartmatic Philippines to just reuse its vote-counting machines (VCMs) in the 2025 midterm elections polls to save billions.,Rodriguez, chairperson of the House Committee on Constitutional Reforms, noted that Smartmatic made the proposal in a letter it sent to the Comelec leadership last May 13.,Rodriguez cited the country’s economic struggles “with a ballooning public debt as well as a yawning budget deficit, which forced the national government to spend less and slowed down economic growth.”,“The Comelec should highly consider the savings to be derived from utilizing existing VCMs,” Rodriguez said. “The Comelec should act prudently and be practical in its approach. Unfortunately, the only alternative it presented is its contract with Miru, which will cost the government P17 billion, notwithstanding the company’s checkered record based on recent elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Iraq.”,Rodriguez was referring to the P17.9 billion automated vote-counting contract between the poll body and the joint venture led by South Korean firm Miru Systems Co. Ltd.,He said there is no compelling need to purchase new machines for the 2025 elections since Smartmatic has reaffirmed its commitment to honor its contract with the Comelec on the over 90,000 VCM’s leased to the body last 2015.,Smartmatic has said the 93,977 precinct based Optical Mark Readers (OMR) and the accompanying Election Management System (EMS) are still covered by the warranty which has been extended to include three subsequent national and local elections after the 2016 polls.,Smartmatic has said that Comelec still owns the Automated Election System (AES) software for EMS, the vote counting system, consolidated canvassing system (CCS) or the overall system used in the 2015 elections, which the body procured for P 402.73 million in 2021.,The Supreme Court earlier ruled that the poll body committed grave abuse of discretion when it disqualified Smartmatic-TIM from participating in the bidding for the 2025 AES contract.,However, the SC did not nullify the multi-billion contract that the Comelec has inked with Miru, which was awarded the Full Automation System with Transparency Audit and Count (FASTrAC) project.,Miru has started manufacturing the automated counting machines (ACMs) to be used in the May 2025 elections. It recently turned over 20 ACMs to the poll body for quality compliance testing.,Caloocan Rep. Edgar Erice earlier filed a petition urging the High Court to cancel the contract and issue a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction to stop the Comelec from implementing its resolution awarding the multi-billion peso contract to Miru and its partners St. Timothy Construction Corp. and Centerpoint Solutions Technologies.,THE Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) yesterday reported that labor standards compliance is the foremost concern of workers in the country.,Citing data from its free call center facility, Hotline 1349, DOLE said the majority of the calls they have been receiving are about compliance with general labor standards.,“The Hotline said it has fielded over 126,000 calls, mostly on labor standards, from 2023 until the first quarter of the year (2024),” said DOLE.,Last year, the DOLE said hotline representatives responded to 83,683 queries on labor standards.,In the first quarter of 2024, the Department said the hotline received 24,649 calls on labor standards.,“Among the inquiries raised by callers were the release of final pay; computation of holiday pay; separation, suspension, and termination; and non-remittance of employees’ contributions to government-mandated benefits, such as SSS, PhilHealth, and Pag-IBIG,” said DOLE.,The Department said other calls cover questions on local employment opportunities and the process of job hiring and placement.,For 2023, it said there were 9,177 queries on social protection and welfare; 4,171 queries on employment facilitation, including TUPAD and youth employment programs; and 1,329 queries on labor relations.,In the first quarter of 2024, the DOLE hotline received 3,100 calls on employment facilitation; 1,549 calls on social protection and welfare; and 278 calls on labor relations.,DOLE’s Hotline 1349 is mandated to provide immediate response and action on labor and employment concerns of Filipino workers., ,THE Legazpi City government earned a pat on the back from the Commission on Audit after revenue collections in 2023 hit P1.731 billion million, which was P237.51 million higher than the P1.49 billion target for the year.,Auditors noted improvement in collection from 25 revenue sources of the city, with the biggest windfall coming from Business Taxes which contributed P76.49 million to Legazpi’s coffers.,Percentage-wise, the biggest increases were recorded in the collection of Franchise Tax, tax on sand, gravel and other quarry products, fines and penalties, cemetery operations, and amusement taxes.,The audit team said the city could further increase its income by hitting projects in 10 other revenue items that did not meet the targets last year, including community taxes, tax on delivery vehicles, cand clearances and certification fees.,“We commended the Management for their continued efforts to improve their revenue forecasting system and collection effort that will ensure the realization of revenue targets, thus, funding for plans and programs …to ensure the delivery of public service,” it added.,The city government said it is conducting periodic reviews of collection performances by concerned offices to improve forecasting and collection systems.,Despite the improved revenue generation however, auditors noted a six percent drop in income year on year from P1.84 billion in 2022 to P1.731 billion in 2023.,“The significant decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the actual Share from National Tax Allotment/Internal Revenue Allotment amounting to P164,525,567,” they noted.,Likewise contributing to the decline were collections of Real Property Transfer Tax which fell by P6.19 million and the Special Education Tax P7.67 million.,FOUR hospital buildings constructed by the provincial government of Albay to the tune of P198.47 million remain vacant more than a year after completion despite congestion in two major hospitals also operated by the local government.,Government auditors blamed poor planning and unsound asset management practices contrary to the provisions of RA 7160 or the Local Government Code.,The buildings were identified as the three-level Hospital Building at the Ziga Memorial District Hospital (ZMDH) in Tabaco City constructed at the cost of P159.55 million; and the Charity Ward (P17.99 million), the Optical/Dental Clinic (P7.95 million), and the Health Workers’ Quarters (P12.99 million) – all three at the Josefina Belmonte Duran Albay Provincial Hospital (JBDAPH) in Ligao City.,According to records, the Health Workers’ Quarters at the JBDAPH was completed way back September 3, 2020 while the three other buildings were turned over to the province between February and November 2022.,Auditors found none of the four structures has been occupied since the three-storey building at the ZMDH still does not have any furnishing while the three finished buildings at the JBDAPH are still unconnected to a power supply.,The Commission on Audit said the two hospitals are the biggest ones in the province but both have seen congestion as patients are not turned away despite exceeding available bed capacities. Existing structures at both health care facilities are already old and are in urgent need of repair.,“The three buildings in JBDAPH… are yet to be connected to a power supply source. Management explained that they are waiting for the completion of the new hospital facility for the power source, the construction of which is still ongoing,” the COA noted.,Four other buildings constructed by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) to create additional spaces at the ZMDH are also ready for occupancy except none have electricity. These are the new Infectious Disease Building, the Employees’ Quarters, the Chief of Hospital’s Quarters, and the hospital morgue.,“In summary, these facilities have been completed for years, but were not utilized immediately because they are not ready for operation. The implementation is taking too long, that the buildings and structures are already depreciating from being idle,” the COA pointed out.,In its comment to the audit observations, the provincial government assured the COA that it will undertake steps to put all the new buildings to use and improve healthcare in the province.,THE four long-lost pulpit panels from the Archdiocesan Shrine of Patrocinio de Maria Santissima are set to come home to Boljoon, Cebu.,This was according to the Archdiocese of Cebu (AOC), which reported the “productive and constructive” meeting they had with the National Museum of the Philippines (NMP) last Tuesday.,“The meeting between the AOC and NMP is very productive and constructive that will surely be advantageous for the valorization of the cultural heritage of the Archdiocese of Cebu, particularly in Boljoon,” the Cebu archdiocese said in a statement.,“The main point of the mutual agreements between the Archdiocese of Cebu and National Museum of the Philippines (is that the) pulpit panels will certainly be returned to Boljoon,” it added.,However, the Cebu Archdiocese said the issue over the ownership of the pulpit panels has yet to be settled.,“The issue of ownership will be settled separately due to pertinent technicalities that bind both parties that will be settled first before the issue of ownership is resolved,” said the archdiocese.,Last February, Cebu Archbishop Jose Palma asked the NMP to return the four long-lost pulpit panels, saying the said sacred items were removed from the church without permission.,The appeal comes a week after the NMP announced its receipt of early 19th-century panels depicting the founder of the Augustinian Order from “private collectors” Edwin and Aileen Bautista.,Beyond the issue on pulpit panels, the archdiocese said the NMP will have additional projects with the Archdiocesan Shrine of Patrocinio de Maria Santissima.,“NMP expressed willingness to collaborate with the archdiocese when it comes to the conservation and restoration of the Boljoon Heritage complex, which covers the church, convent, museum, escuela catolica, and their adjunct structures,” said the Archdiocese of Cebu.,THE Justice Department yesterday recommended the filing of charges against a Canadian who has been implicated in last month’s drug bust in Alitagtag, Batangas that resulted in the seizure of 1.4 tons of shabu worth P9.68 billion.,Thomas Gordon Quinn, who is using the aliases “James Toby Martin,” “Robert Wagner,” “Steve MC Donald,” and “Jay Macallan” was apprehended last May 16 in a spa in Tagaytay City.,The DOJ wants him charged for possession of illegal drugs and use of fictitious names.,His arrest stemmed from an Interpol’s Red Notice against him in connection with a pending arrest warrant in the United States for drug-related charges.,During his arrest, Authorities confiscated from Quinn 45 grams of shabu and 81.65 grams of cocaine as well as several identification cards under different names with the same facial photographs.,Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said during inquest proceedings last Friday, the National Prosecution Service “found sufficient evidence” against Quinn to cause the filing of criminal information for two counts of violation of Section 11 (possession of dangerous drugs) of Republic Act 9165 or the Comprehensive Drugs Act of 2002 and for using fictitious names.,An investigation conducted by the PNP-National Capital Region Police Office Intelligence Division revealed that Quinn was among those allegedly involved in the Alitagtag drug case.,Remulla said that since Quinn was implicated in the Alitagtag drug case, the NPS will conduct a further case build-up and preliminary investigation to determine his participation and the involvement of others in the case.,The recommendation to indict Quinn was related to the seizure of illegal drugs when he was arrested in Tagaytay.,A WOMEN and child rights defender whom the Department of Justice (DOJ) said was a member of the communist New Peoples Army (NPA) has been convicted and sentenced to 10 to 17 years in prison by a Taguig city court for participating in a series of attacks against military personnel and communication facilities in Quezon province in 2005.,In a 56-page decision promulgated last 16 May 2024, the Taguig City Regional Trial Court Branch 266 found Maria Salome Crisostomo, also known as Maria Salome Crisostomo Ujano, “guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rebellion.”,The court sentenced Ujano to suffer the indeterminate penalty of 10 years of prision mayor as minimum, to 17 years and four months of reclusion temporal as maximum.,Court records showed that Ujano on separate incidents from November 19 to 25, 2005 led attacks against security forces, resulting to the killing and wounding of several Army soldiers and police officers, while destroying communication sites and various government properties in the municipalities of Tiaong, Sariaya and Lucban.,During the trial, Ujano denied she was an NPA member and claimed that on the dates that the prosecution alleged she led the rebels in attacking security forces in Quezon, she was not in the province and that she was attending classes at the St. Scholastica College in Malate, Manila.,She said she also reported to the Women’s Crisis Center on the said dates as she is the group’s Executive Director for six years.,Ujano, who was arrested in November 2021, said she also served as the National Coordinator of the Philippine Against Child Trafficking since 2008.,But Presiding Judge Marivic Vitor said the prosecution witnesses, including several Army soldiers and police officers who figured in the series of clashes with NPA members, positively identified Ujano.,“Positive identification where categorical and consistent and without any showing of ill motive on the part of the eyewitness testifying on the matter, prevails over a denial which, if not substantiated by clear and convincing evidence is negative and self-serving evidence undeserving of weight in law. They cannot be given greater evidentiary value over the testimony of credible witnesses who testify on affirmative matters,” the court ruling said.,“For the defense, accused Ujano testified that she was reporting at WCC on November 19, 21 to 25, 2005 executing her functions as Executive Director. Nonetheless her presence in their office or elsewhere on such dates were not supported by clear and convincing evidence,” the court added.,The RTC said it is not convinced with Ujano’s alibi, adding that the Supreme Court has held in several cases that alibi and denial are are inherently weak defenses especially when confronted with positive identification by witnesses.,“Such positive identification, being categorical and consistent, could not be undone by alibi and denial in the absence of any credible showing of ill motive on the part of the identifying witnesses,” the court explained.,“In conclusion, the Court finds that the prosecution was able to prove the guilt of accused Ujano beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rebellion,” it added.,Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said the court’s decision is another victory in the government’s effort to fight terrorism in the country.,“We stood united once again in the face of sinister terrorists and conquered this menace by our resilience and unity. We will never back down against such evil who continue to destabilize the government and sow discord and division. This is the very guarantee we can give our country and people,” Remulla said in a statement.,He also lauded the DOJ Task Force on Counter-Terrorism and Terrorism Financing led by Senior Deputy State Prosecutor Peter Ong “for successfully prosecuting the case which led to the conviction of Ujano.”,MIGRANT Workers Secretary Hans Leo Cacdac yesterday accepted the decision of the Commission on Appointments (CA) to defer its ruling on his appointment as head of the youngest agency in the government.,In a statement, Cacdac said he submits to the wisdom of the CA regarding his confirmation as Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) secretary.,“I defer to the wisdom of the members of the Commission to have more time to consider and deliberate on my appointment,” said Cacdac.,“I humbly submit myself to this process, which, I am deeply aware, is the bedrock of our democracy,” he added.,Last Tuesday, the CA deferred deliberations on the ad interim appointment of Cacdac, who was appointed DMW secretary last April 25.,SAGIP Party-List Representative Rodante Marcoleta moved to suspend the deliberations for “lack of material time.”,Whatever the decision of the CA, Cacdac said he was grateful for the opportunity to lead the agency.,“I thank the President for his trust in appointing me as Ad Interim Secretary,” he said.",https://malaya.com.ph/news_news/news-highlights-may-23-2024/
House OKs divorce bill anew; prods Senate to pass own version,Wendell Vigilia,"May 23, 2024","THE House of Representatives yesterday approved on third and final reading a bill seeking to legalize absolute divorce and allowing the dissolution of marriages to liberate couples in problematic marriages.,The divorce bill was first approved by the House in March 2018 under the 17th Congress.,However, the bill only gathered dust in the Senate after senators sat on the measure.,Voting 126-109 with 20 abstentions yesterday, congressmen approved Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman’s House Bill No. 9349 during the last day of the Second Regular Session of the 19th Congress.,Lagman’s bill seeks to institute absolute divorce as an alternative mode of dissolving an irreparably broken or dysfunctional marriage in the country which is predominantly Roman Catholic.,Lagman told the plenary after the bill’s passage, “Starting tomorrow (Thursday), we shall begin our campaign in the Senate so that its counterpart measure which has long been ripe for plenary deliberation shall similarly be passed,”,Under the bill, troubled couples may file a petition for absolute divorce using the following grounds: legal separation under Article 55 of the Family Code of the Philippines, as modified; annulment of marriage under Article 45 of the Family Code of the Philippines, as modified; separation of the spouses in fact for at least five years at the time the petition for absolute divorce is filed, and reconciliation is highly improbable; psychological incapacity as provided in Article 36 of the Family Code of the Philippines; irreconcilable differences; and domestic or marital abuse to include acts under Republic Act 9262, or the Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004.,Lagman said that “as the only country in the world besides the Vatican where divorce is still illegal, this is a clear and resounding victory and signals the imminent liberation for Filipino wives who are entombed in toxic, abusive, and long-dead marriages.”,“By legalizing divorce, the Philippines acknowledges the need to provide options for individuals trapped in unhappy and irreparable marriages. This recognition reflects an evolving understanding of the complexities and challenges that can arise within marital unions,” he said.,Lagman assured critics of the measure that a divorce law will not destroy marriages because “divorce does not put asunder a marriage as the union has long perished.”,“What will be before the Family Court is a cadaver of a marriage. Divorce is not the monster plaguing a marriage. It is marital infidelity, abandonment, violence, and cruelty, among others, which are the devils that destroy marriages,” he said.,The veteran lawyer-lawmaker also said a divorce law “is constitutional as the Constitution does not prevent the Congress from enacting a divorce law even as it does not offend the dogma of the Catholic Church which has its own canonical dissolution of marriage. All other Catholic and Christian countries in the world have long legitimized divorce.”",https://malaya.com.ph/news_news/house-oks-divorce-bill-anew-prods-senate-to-pass-own-version/
Marcos advised: Avoid public places in SG,Jocelyn Montemayor,"May 23, 2024","HEALTH Secretary Teodoro Herbosa Jr. yesterday advised President Marcos Jr. and his delegation to exercise public health precautions, including avoiding crowds, when they visit Singapore later this month amid a reported spike in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in the said country.,Marcos is set to participate in the International Institute for Strategic Studies Shangri-la Dialogue 2024 in Singapore in late May.,Herbosa, in an interview after a sectoral meeting in Malacañang, said the President’s security team should make sure that he is not exposed to any threat in case Marcos decides to go to crowded public places.,“Public health precautions, you know. To avoid crowds. Of course, the President naman doesn’t go to crowded and public places because of the security (Anyway, the President does not go to crowded and public places because of security issues),” Herbosa said.,Herbosa said the Philippines is closely monitoring the situation in Singapore amid the reported rise in COVID cases and the presence of the new variants KP.2 and KP.3 — collectively nicknamed by scientists as “FLiRT.” The new variants are reportedly mutations of the JN.1 variant.,He said that while there are no reported cases of FLiRT in the Philippines yet, he said there is a possibility that it has already entered the country.,He said a private hospital, which he refused to name, had reported that some of its medical workers have recently tested positive of COVID-19. He also said that the health department is monitoring a spike in influenza-like illnesses.,Herbosa assured the public that the FLiRT variant “is not serious” and is only classified as a “variant under monitoring” but noted that it spreads fast.,“Sa Philippines, we don’t have enough samples kasi we need a number of samples to do the genetic testing… Pag dumating ‘yung cases, then, we will ask our Philippine Genome Center to again look at what variant is spreading (In the Philippines, we don’t have enough samples, we need a number of samples to do the genetic testing… once cases are recorded, we will ask the Philippine Genome Center to again look at what variant is spreading),” he said.,Herbosa urged Filipinos to practice proper health protocols as a precautionary measure against getting infected with the new COVID-19 variants.,Likewise, he said he is not yet recommending any border control or travel restrictions to countries with increasing COVID-19 cases, the mandatory use of face masks or additional vaccination.,“I am advising every Filipino, since that’s happening, that it can come here… (to practice) minimum public health standards. If you are sick, you have a cough, colds, sore throat, better to stay home. If you need to go out, wear a mask. So, it’s still personal,” he said.,Herbosa added that previous practices such as self-isolation may also be observed, especially if a person is experiencing respiratory symptoms which do not clear up within five days of onset.,He also said self-precautions, such as maintaining vaccine immunity and avoiding travel to countries with high cases of COVID-19 for people who are at risk or vulnerable should be observed.,DOH spokesperson Albert Domingo said those who have been vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19 should not worry of the waning effect of the vaccines.,“If we were vaccinated with the primary series and the booster doses, we are fully vaccinated. Therefore, we have a weapon against this (new wave),” said Domingo.,“It can be said that its effects are waning over time. But its efficacy remains present in our bodies,” he added.,Proof of this, he said, is that COVID-19 cases in the country had remained low in the last several months.,For the period of May 7 to 13, DOH data shows that there were 877 new COVID-19 cases reported, for an average of 125 cases reported per day.,Similarly, data shows that the occupancy rate of COVID-19 ICU beds and COVID-19 non-ICU beds are only at 11 percent (119/1,117) and 13 percent (1,238/9,571), respectively, as of May 12.,Because of this, the health official said there is no need for Filipinos to be alarmed over the latest surge in COVID-19 cases in Singapore.,“We don’t have to be alarmed but we must be on alert. We are on alert. We are watching,” said Domingo.,Earlier, Singapore reported a new COVID-19 wave due to the rising cases of infection over the last two weeks.,Singapore data shows that there were 25,900 cases of COVID-19 recorded during the week of May 5 to May 11 as compared to only 13,700 cases in the previous week.

LPA seen to intensify into tropical depression,Victor Reyes,"May 23, 2024","A CLUSTER of clouds east of Mindanao yesterday developed into a low pressure area (LPA) which may intensify into a tropical depression in the coming days.,PAGASA weather specialist Loriedin dela Cruz Galicia said the LPA was still outside the Philippine area of responsibility (PAR) as of yesterday morning, or some 1,255 km east of southeastern Mindanao.,The LPA had been expected to enter the country Wednesday night or Thursday morning.,“Then it may affect or it may make landfall in the area between Bicol region and Eastern Visayas by late Friday or on weekend, Saturday, as an LPA,” Galicia said.,Galicia said the LPA may emerge in the waters east of Luzon on Sunday or Monday and later intensify into a tropical depression.,“We are not ruling the possibility it will develop into a tropical depression after emerging in the waters east of Luzon,” she added.,If the LPA becomes a tropical depression, it will be named “Aghon.”",https://malaya.com.ph/news_news/lpa-seen-to-intensify-into-tropical-depression-3/
Show-cause order issued vs ex-Duterte adviser Yang,Wendell Vigilia,"May 23, 2024","THE House committee on dangerous drugs yesterday issued a show-cause order to Chinese businessman Michael Yang, an economic adviser of former President Rodrigo Duterte, to explain why he did not attend the panel’s hearing on the discovery of 560 kilos of shabu in a warehouse in Mexico, Pampanga in September last year.,The panel chaired by Surigao del Norte Rep. Robert Ace Barbers issued the order after Yang snubbed the probe yesterday, with his lawyer, Raymund Fortun, saying his client is in Dubai for a business trip.,Fortun initially told lawmakers that Yang was very busy, having left the country eight times since October last year, but Sta. Rosa Rep. Dan Fernandez, chair of the committee on public order and safety, found the reason unacceptable and urged the panel to subpoena Duterte’s friend to compel him to attend the next hearing.,But Rep. Joseph Stephen Paduano (PL, Abang Lingkod), chair of the committee on public accounts, moved that the panel issue a show-cause order, saying it should be done first “so we will not be accused of violating due process.”,Antipolo Rep. Romeo Acop, chair of the committee on transportation, agreed with Paduano and the panel later voted six against one to approve Paduano’s motion.,Yang was invited to answer questions in connection with the P3.6 billion drug bust by the NBI and Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) after the committee found out that Empire 999 Realty Corp., the company that owns the warehouse where the drugs were found, appears to be owned by Chinese citizens who have been previously linked to anomalous activities under the past administration.,It was through the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) port that the illegal drugs entered the country before being transported to Barangay San Jose Malino in Mexico.,The panel earlier discovered that Yang’s interpreter, Linconn Ong, a controversial figure in the Pharmally scandal, is an incorporator of a company with links to other companies, including Empire 999, owned by suspected Chinese drug lord Willie Ong whose real identity is believed is to be Cai Qimeng.,Pharmally was investigated after it cornered billions in contracts with the Procurement Service of the Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM), headed by then Undersecretary Christopher Lao, for the supply of medical needs during the pandemic under the Duterte administration. It was later revealed the acquisition of supplies abroad was financed by Yang.,Yang had been identified by former anti-drug law enforcement officer Col. Eduardo Acierto and whistle-blower and self-confessed former Davao Death Squad (DDS) hitman Arturo Lascañas as a drug kingpin.,Barbers said Ong used a fake Filipino identity which allowed his real estate firm and associates to acquire a total of 291 titled lands in various parts of Central Luzon and Metro Manila worth several billions of pesos.,He said Ong and his Chinese associates identified as Aedi Tai Yang, Jack Tai Yang, Mischelle Santos Sy, Elaine Chua, among others, were able to register their firm with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) posing as Filipinos with spurious Filipino passports and other government-issued identification cards.,Citing data provided by the Land Registration Authority, the lawmaker said the firm Empire 999 acquired 41 titled land holdings; Ong with 59; Aedi Tai Yang with 11; Jack Tai Yang, 15; Mischelle Santos Sy, 53; Elain Chua 92; Albert Valdez Sy, 6; Na Wong, 1; Ana Ong, 5; Cai Quimeng, the Chinese name of Willie Ong, 6; and James Valdez, 2.,Barbers said he would ask the Department of Justice or any of the concerned government agencies to file an “adverse claim” against the real estate properties before the subjects could dispose or sell it in haste to protect would-be buyers.,“Ong and his associates own a total of 291 (properties) and we have to let the public know that these are questionable properties to protect anyone who will be asked to buy it,” he said.,Barbers said the panel also has to know how vast the properties are “and if these were brought in cash, through banks or if they used laundered money from proceeds from their drug business or other illegal transactions.”,Empire 999 Realty firm, Ong and his associates, have land holding acquisitions in Mexico, San Fernando, and Angeles City in Pampanga; Nueva Ecija, Cabanatuan City, Aurora Province, Bulacan, Cavite City, Tagaytay City, Iloilo City, Lingayen, Pangasinan, Mandaue City, Lapu-Lapu City, Valenzuela City, Quezon City, Rizal, Muntinlupa City, Taguig City, Makati City, Malabon, Paranaque City, Manila City, Davao del Norte, Isulan, Sultan Kudarat, and Tabuk, Kalinga, Apayao.,“Ong and his associates posed as Filipinos in conducting real estate business in our country and this is not allowed under our laws,” Barbers said. “And we have yet to ascertain what kind of or source of money they used in their buying spree, the real size of lands they acquired, and their value in pesos as of present.”,If the persons involved are not Filipinos, Barbers said they are prohibited by law from owning lands, including Empire 999, which is clearly not 60 percent Filipino-owned as required by the Constitution.,Barbers said the lands acquired should be “invalidated and forfeited in favor of the government.,“To date, Empire 999 Realty and its individual incorporators have amassed more or less 292 titled lands, amounting to hundreds if not thousands of hectares, in Pampanga alone,” he said.,The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) confirmed there is an entry for “Willie Ong” as the owner of Empire 999 Realty Corp. through a certification issued by a Local Civil Registrar in Meycauayan, Bulacan on August 31, 2001.,Barbers said the certification states that Ong was born in the municipality on May 29, 1977, 24 years before the certification was registered but the current Local Civil Registrar of Meycauayan showed there is no such record for Willie Ong and the entry specified was for another person.,“Upon the committee’s initiative, the new and acting Local Civil Registrar of Meycauayan issued a certification dated May 7, 2024 stating that no record exists under the name Willie Ong, allegedly born on May 29, 1977 with Registry No. 127 for the year 1977. Said Registry No. 127 lists another person born on a different date,” Barbers said.,He said the same Willie Ong was able to secure a Philippine passport “which he has renewed several times, the last being in July 2019, valid until 2029.,“How he was able to get one remains a mystery. At least we were able to find serious lapses in our agencies’ security systems and processes,” Barbers said.,“Upon very careful examination by the Bureau of Immigration, the Philippine passport that Willie Ong possesses was never used. However, another person of Chinese nationality with the name of Cai Qimeng, born on July 24, 1977, departed for Hong Kong on October 10, 2023, the day after we started this investigation,” he added.",https://malaya.com.ph/news_news/show-cause-order-issued-vs-ex-duterte-adviser-yang/
Bamban mayor not Pinoy? Parents have no PSA records,Raymond Africa,"May 23, 2024","SENATORS expressed their belief yesterday that Mayor Alice Guo of Bamban, Tarlac is not a Filipino citizen after major discrepancies were found in her birth certificate issued by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA).,Senate deputy minority leader Risa Hontiveros, who chairs the Committee on Women, said research conducted by her office revealed that Guo’s father, Angelito Guo, a Chinese, has no birth records with the PSA. Her mother, a certain Amelia Villaruel Leal, also has no birth records with the PSA.,These were revealed when the committee held its eighth hearing on allegations that Guo is allegedly protecting the POGO hub raided by authorities in Bamban last March.,Hontiveros also said the mayor’s parents have no PSA record of being married, contrary to what was listed in Guo’s birth certificate that they were married.,Marizza Grande of the PSA said the agency conducted a fact-finding investigation on Guo and found several discrepancies in her birth certificate, like the fact that Angelito Guo was listed as Filipino in Guo’s birth certificate. However, the mayor said her father is Chinese and has a Chinese passport.,Hontiveros said that since Angelito Guo registered his daughter’s birth when she was already 19, it was possible he provided false information for whatever reason.,Responding to a question raised by Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian on whether Amelia Leal is not a real person, lawyer Eliezar Ambatali, the PSA’s legal service director, said it is possible as “there are several irregularities in this birth certificate.”,He also questioned why Angelito Guo has been frequently traveling to China since based on immigration records, the mayor’s father travels to China two to three times a month.,“Negosyo niya dito ay hindi kumikita pero bumibiyahe siya doon (His business here is not earning and yet he can afford to travel to China),” he said, adding the Anti-Money Laundering Council should investigate Angelito Guo.,Ambatali said a case may be filed to cancel a person’s birth certificate if it does not meet the minimum requirements needed to declare a birth certificate valid.,Hontiveros also disputed the mayor’s claim that she is an only child, saying research by her committee showed Angelito and Amelia have three children, two registered in Caloocan City and the other in Bamban, Tarlac.,The mayor said she only learned that the incorporators of Baofu Land Development Inc., where she has a 50 percent stake, are involved in criminal activities through social media.,Senate president pro tempore Jinggoy Estrada said he has information that Guo has a “partner” involved in the operations of the raided POGO hub in Bamban. Guo responded by saying she has never had an affair with anybody, more so someone involved in the POGO hub.,Hontiveros said Guo was obviously lying before the committee, citing her Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth.,“Ipinipilit ninyo na simpleng tao lang kayo pero ang laman ng SALN niyo ay daan-daang milyong piso. Mayor Guo, pagsisinungaling pa rin po ang paglilihim ng katotohanan (You are insisting that you are a simple person but your SALN shows you are worth millions of pesos. Mayor Guo, hiding the truth is also lying),” Hontiveros said.,Hontiveros said law enforcement agencies have come forward to present “more comprehensive findings” about Guo that they will discuss with her in an executive session.,“Findings that involve national security and transnational organized crime,” she added.,Gatchalian said they must craft measures so the late registration of birth records would not be abused.",https://malaya.com.ph/news_news/bamban-mayor-not-pinoy-parents-have-no-psa-records/
DOJ sees violation of wiretapping law by Chinese Embassy,Raymond Africa,"May 23, 2024","THE Department of Justice yesterday said the Chinese Embassy can be held liable for violating the Philippines’ anti-wiretapping law for recording a phone conversation between one of its officials and a Filipino military general, without the latter’s consent.,The statement was made by Senior State Counsel Fretti Ganchoon during a Senate hearing attended by, among others, Vice Adm. Alberto Carlos who resigned as commander of the AFP Western Command (Wescom) earlier this month amid the controversy about a supposed “new model” agreement with China in handling the territorial dispute in the South China Sea, particularly at Ayungin Shoal.,Carlos confirmed he had a phone conversation with a Chinese military attaché in January this year. A supposed transcript of the conversation had been given to select media outlets,
Ganchoon, at the hearing of the Senate Committee on National Defense on the alleged wiretapping by the Chinese Embassy, said the DOJ had no information as to the veracity of the Chinese Embassy’s claims until Carlos broke his silence on the matter.,He said the Department of Foreign Affairs also “did not know of the truthfulness of this transcript” since the government is very careful to make comments regarding the matter due to the tension in the West Philippine Sea in the South China Sea.,“This is the first time that we are hearing the sworn testimony of Vice Admiral Carlos because we were not also sure before of the truthfulness, the authenticity of the transcript, Mr. Chair. So, we don’t know, but we have a testimony now that we can use that indeed there was a call and it was recorded,” Ganchoon said.,“So, it could be considered as a violation of the wiretapping law,” he added.,Ganchoon said concerned government agencies have been very careful with how they treat such things since they do not want to further escalate the tension with China.,“So, anything that comes from them, we treat them very carefully. So, we did not accept it right away that this transcript is authentic, that the transcript is true, that there was wiretapping. But now that we have a sworn testimony from Vice Admiral (Carlos), we thank him that there indeed was wiretapping. But with respect to the contents, of course Mr. Chair, we are not talking here about the contents yet,” he said.,During the hearing, Alberto admitted receiving a phone call from a Chinese military attaché but denied entering into the so-called “new model” of agreement governing Ayungin Shoal.,Carlos said he got the call from “Senior Col. Li” at the early part of January this year while he was aboard a vessel in the middle of West Philippine Sea (WPS) on their way to a rotation and resupply (RORE) mission.,Carlos said he was sure it was Li who called him because the latter’s number is registered in his phone’s phonebook. He said he met Li in official functions.,He said the conversation was “very informal” and “casual,” and lasted for about 3 to 5 minutes.,At first, he said, he thought Li called just to greet him a “happy new year” since it was made at the early part of January.,“I did not forge any agreement at the level and magnitude that would bind our two countries for the long term and redefine foreign policy. I am only the commander of the Western Command and not even of the entire West Philippine Sea,” Carlos said.,He added that he did not consent to having their conversation recorded.,“I have not given my consent to record to anybody and I have not been asked for permission to do so, Mr. Chair,” he said.,He said the supposed “new model” was never part of their conversation,Carlos said that he did not receive any call from Li after that conversation, but the Chinese military attaché tried to reach out to him “two days ago through Viber.”,“He sent me a message two days ago, sir, but I did not acknowledge,” he said, adding that he can show the supposed text message to him and provide other details of his conversation with Li to senators in an executive session.,When asked if Li was probably “guilty” that he was the source of the leaked conversation, Carlos said: “That is a reasonable assumption, sir.”,Carlos said he has not entered into any agreement with any Chinese official since he became Wescom chief in January 2022.,Carlos said “there are lot of things” said about him the last two weeks regarding that “new model” of agreement with China, which are all false.,“At my level, I have tried my best to operationalize the President’s marching orders to de-escalate the tension in my area of operation. There are stories about me making secret deals with China and their officials. These are completely false,” he said.,“I am not authorized to enter into agreements. And I will never pretend to be my country’s authority on matters regarding policy and country-to-country agreements. That should have been obvious to China’s officials, as it is obvious to everyone else,” he added.,He said that as the former Wescom commander, it is not within his level to enter into any “secret deals” that will compromise the country’s interest.,He urged Filipinos to be “united against this false narrative” for the sake of the country and troops stationed at BRP Sierra Madre.,“I have not compromised the country’s territorial integrity. I have not given up our sovereign rights and entitlements. I am a soldier for the Filipino. I remain a loyal servant of the Republic,” he added.,Senate President pro tempore Jinggoy Estrada, committee chairman, took note of the Chinese Embassy’s apparent “manipulation” of the wiretapped conversation with Carlos and vowed to file the remedial measures.,He said the Chinese Embassy’s action made it appear that a secret deal was made to handle the tension in the WPS.,“This wiretapping incident is worrisome, that’s why we need to act on it. It is even more worrisome that these Chinese officials can manipulate a conversation, to divide us, so we can have doubts on a bemedalled officer like Vice Admiral Carlos),” Estrada said in Filipino.,The new model was first by disclosed by the Chinese embassy last month. The issue resurfaced early this month. The Chinese embassy said the new arrangement led to “smooth” delivery of supplies to troops at Ayungin Shoal in February 2. In March, two succeeding resupply missions were harassed by the Chinese, causing injuries to seven Navy personnel and damage to Philippine Coast Guard and military-chartered supply boats.,Carlos has been re-assigned at Camp Aguinaldo, said AFP spokeswoman Col. Francel Margareth Padilla.,Carlos was replaced by Rear Adm. Alfonso Torres Jr initially in an acting capacity at the Wescom. Last Saturday, the military said Torres’ designation was elevated as full-time Wescom commander.,Padilla said Carlos is now assigned with the General Headquarters and Headquarters Support Command.,“He is under the supervision of the office of the Chief of Staff,” said Padilla, adding Carlos will be performing whatever tasks will be given to him by AFP chief Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr.Padilla said Carlos’ assignment at Camp Aguinaldo is not a punishment.,“Reassignment is never a form punishment… It’s a rotational policy, its a policy,” she said.,
Padilla could not immediately say if Carlos, who is due to reach the retirement age of 56 in December this year, will be given another command to lead.,Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo said relations between Manila and Beijing are a “bit choppy.”,But he added that downgrading ties with Beijing is not in the cards despite the tension due to the maritime territorial dispute.,“We will and we always agreed that we should manage our relationship through diplomatic means and through peaceful means,” he explained.,Manalo said Chinese actions are to blame for the rising tension in the area.,He said these actions range from harassment of Filipino fishermen and blocking patrols and resupply missions to Filipino troops in Ayungin Shoal.,“These actions are and have been inconsistent and are illegal in the sense that they are not consistent with international laws.We are merely trying to assert our rights under international law,” he said.,China claims nearly the entire South China Sea as its own despite losing in the arbitration case filed by the Philippines in 2016. The arbitral award junked China’s sweeping claims in the South China Sea. China refused to honor or abide by the arbitral ruling.,The Philippine Navy said it has “contingency” measures in the event China will arrest and detain Filipino fishermen in the WPS.,Navy spokesman for the West Philippine Sea Commodore Roy Vincent Trinidad echoed President Marcos Jr’s statement that China’s new regulations are “unacceptable” and the Navy will not allow Filipino fishermen to be arrested.,The Chinese regulations, which is due to be implemented on June 15, calls for the detention for up to 60 days of foreigners intruding into its borders, including in the South China Sea.,“Rest assured that we have a lot of contingency plans, not only for this particular incident, but for a range of incidents that may happen,” Trinidad told a press briefing at the Army headquarters at Fort Bonifacio.,On the possibility of an armed conflict breaking out if China pushes through with its plan, Trinidad said: “I don’t want to speculate.”,“Rest assured that that we have a range of options available based on our contingency plans,” said Trinidad, referring to actions that may be taken by the Navy.,Meanwhile, Trinidad said the military is looking into the claim of Filipino fishermen that China is installing pipes at Scarborough Shoal, about 124 nautical miles from Zambales.,China gained control of the shoal in 2012 after a standoff with Philippine government vessels. The Chinese have prevented Filipino fishermen from going inside the shoal since then.,Mark Figueras, of the Atin Ito coalition, said “there has been an activity inside,” referring to pipe installation at the shoal.,Trinidad said, “There were reports of some pipes found under water. But we are still confirming this and rest assured that the National Task Force on the West Philippine Sea will come out with a pronouncement once confirmed,” said Trinidad.,At the House, Immigration Commissioner Norman Tansingco told lawmakers that the influx of Chinese students in the country can be partly attributed to the Commission on Higher Education’s (CHED) promotion of the Philippines as a regional and global educational, referring to the “Study in the Philippines” campaign.,“The Philippine government has been promoting the country as a regional and global education hub. CHED’s ‘study in Philippines campaign’ has greatly boosted the number of foreign students in the country,” Tansingco told the House committee on justice which is looking into the surge of Chinese students in Cagayan province, where some of the sites for the country’s Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) with the United States are located.,According to CHED records, between 2022 and 20223, there were 9,680 Indians students in the country, followed by Chinese (5,921), Nigerians (799), Thai (259) and Nepalese, 186.,Tansingco said the influx of Chinese students may also be an offshoot of a memorandum of understanding signed by CHED and the Chinese Ministry of Education aimed to “to fast track bilateral cooperation on higher education” and another memorandum of agreement between signed in 2019 by then President Rodrigo Duterte with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

UK defence minister says China working to supply lethal aid to Russia,...,"May 23, 2024","LONDON — British defence minister Grant Shapps accused China on Wednesday of providing or preparing to provide Russia with lethal aid for use in its war against Ukraine.,Western nations have provided Ukraine with billions of dollars in weapons and aid since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. Britain for the first time is accusing China of working to supply Russia with weapons for use in Ukraine.,Shapps told a conference in London that U.S. and British defence intelligence had evidence that “lethal aid is now, or will be, flowing from China to Russia and into Ukraine, I think it is a significant development”.,Shapps did not provide evidence to support his assertion. But he said there had been a 64% increase growth in trade between the countries since the start of the Ukraine and “they are covering each other’s back”.,“We should be concerned about that because in the earlier days of this war China would like to present itself as a moderating influence on” Russian President Vladimir Putin, he added.,The Chinese embassy in London did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Shapps’ remarks.,China is backing Russia’s war effort in Ukraine by providing Moscow with drone and missile technology, satellite imagery and machine tools, senior U.S. officials said last month.,The Chinese embassy in the U.S. said last month Beijing had not provided weaponry, adding that it is “not a producer of or party involved in the Ukraine crisis”.,Putin visited China earlier this month, where he and Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged a “new era” of partnership that proclaimed opposition to the United States on a host of security issues and a shared view on everything from Taiwan and Ukraine.,Russia and China proclaimed a “no limits” relationship just days before Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but Beijing avoided providing actual weapons and ammunition for Russia’s war effort.,Shapps said Russia, China, Iran and North Korea had been emboldened by what he called a quarter of a century of “western timidity” towards repression at home and aggression abroad.,He said it was time for the “world to wake up” and that meant all NATO members should start spending 2.5% of their gross domestic product on defence.",https://malaya.com.ph/news_news/uk-defence-minister-says-china-working-to-supply-lethal-aid-to-russia/
