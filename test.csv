"UP pivots to Mindanao, offers MD, engineering courses in Davao City next year",Germelina Lacorte," , / 01:00 PM May 09, 2024","DAVAO CITY — University of the Philippines (UP) President Angelo Jimenez on Tuesday, May 7, announced the national university’s “pivot to Mindanao,” as he revealed the university’s thrust to reach out to more students from disadvantaged sectors and to offer programs that cater to the growing health and development needs of Mindanao.,Jimenez said that UP Mindanao will start offering programs in Doctor of Medicine (MD) next year to address the dismal doctor to citizens’ ratio prevailing here; and other courses in engineering and entrepreneurship to support Mindanao’s “development aspirations.”,Jimenez said while the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended an ideal ratio of one doctor for every 1,000 population, the country only has 3.7 doctors for every 10,000 people. In Davao City, the ratio is as low as one doctor for every 40,000 population.,“In Davao, we are very concerned about health. The data they gave me is 1 doctor for every 40,000. So hopefully by next year, we can establish the UP College of Medicine at UP Mindanao to produce more local doctors in Mindanao,” Jimenez told reporters.,He said that instead of waiting for years to build a facility, UP would rent a space to set up the college and to make use of the Southern Philippines Medical Center (SPMC) as a teaching facility. He said a lot of doctors here who graduated from the UP College of Medicine would be very happy to help.,If plans push through, UP Mindanao would be the first state university in Davao City to offer an MD program.,Jimenez, the first UP President to come from Mindanao and the first UP President to hold his investiture here when he assumed office in September last year, said part of the thrust of his administration would be to democratize access to UP education to a much broader spectrum of the population.,He said UP would give full support to passers of the UP College Aptitude Test (UPCAT) who would have a hard time entering UP because of financial reasons.,According to Jimenez, of the 100,000 students who take the UPCAT exams each year, only about 10 per cent are taken. But among those who passed, there are 1,400 to 1,500 students that do not enroll.,“Of course, there are those who (don’t enroll because they had other options), but we want to focus on the disadvantaged sectors. We noted that 40 percent of (those who don’t enroll) had no money to support education even if it’s already free (because) the cost of education does not consist only of tuition but also include the cost of food, library, transport, dormitories, even books and right now, because of the highly technical nature of knowledge delivery, you need (budget for) communication, particularly internet communication, including gadgets laptops, tablets, so we’re going to correct that right now,” he said.,Of the 350 UPCAT passers identified to be from the disadvantaged sectors this year, 60 are in Mindanao and will be studying at UP Mindanao, he said. “That’s how determined we are,” he said, adding that UP would be allotting P85,000 to P150,000 budget for housing, food allowance, transport and other non-tuition expenses for each student in this sector.,“The UPCAT still remains to be the most difficult exam in the country, so if somebody from the marginalized (sector) passed the UPCAT, that is extraordinary. We feel, as a first step, yun lang muna ang saluhin namin (those are whom we’re going to answer),” he said. “We are going to focus on that sector of UPCAT passers who for some extraordinary reasons passed the toughest exams in the country currently dominated by students from private schools,” he said.,Prof. Lyre Anni E. Murao, chancellor of UP Mindanao, said they were also targeting to increase student enrollment here from the current 1,400 students to 5,000 by year 2029.

Elusive ‘clock of mountains’ bird documented on Mt. Apo,Edwin O. Fernandez," , / 05:04 AM May 09, 2024","KIDAPAWAN CITY, COTABATO, Philippines — Another endangered wildlife has been documented by environmentalists in Mt. Apo Natural Park in Cotabato province, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) said.,Felix Alicer, DENR regional director in Soccsksargen (South Cotabato, Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, Sarangani and General Santos), said a team of biologists had recorded the first sighting of the elusive southern rufous hornbill (Buceros mindanensis) during a monitoring activity on May 2 in Magpet town.,According to Alicer, the southern rufous hornbill is endemic to Mindanao and is characterized by its dark reddish brown head and neck, and a red casque on top of its bill.,The upper part of its bill is red with ridges, while the lower part is lighter red with a yellowish-white front.,Its eyes are yellowish-grey, blue-grey or pale green, and it has black skin around its eyes, Alicer said. Both male and female birds have black underparts, a brown back and wings, and a white tail.,“This avian species’ honking calls serve as a reminder of the time of day resonating through the wilderness every hour. This unique characteristic has earned it the moniker ‘clock of the mountains’ among the Ubu Monuvu people, symbolizing its close connection to the natural rhythms of the forest,” Alicer described the bird in a statement released on Tuesday.,The Ubu Monuvu tribe is among the indigenous peoples known as custodian of Mt. Apo’s ancestral lands.,Because it feeds on fruits, the southern rufous hornbill “assumes a critical ecological role in seed dispersal, thereby facilitating the regeneration and maintenance of invaluable forest ecosystems,” Alicer said.,The bird is listed as “vulnerable” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.,Alicer said recent studies suggested that illegal hunting and poaching for the pet trade, coupled with habitat destruction, were driving forces behind the declining population of the southern rufous hornbill.,Last week, DENR personnel documented four Philippine trogon (Harpactes ardens), a bird species associated with the mythical “Ibong Adarna,” and two species of squirrels — the Philippine pygmy squirrel (Exilisciurus concinnus) and the Mindanao tree squirrel (Sundasciurus mindanensis), in the remaining forests of Mt.

"Baguio health-care workers seek P33,000 entry pay",Vincent Cabreza," , / 05:02 AM May 09, 2024","BAGUIO CITY, Philippines — About 200 doctors, nurses, medical students and other health-care workers on Tuesday joined a “unity walk” to assert their rights and to demand a mandatory entry salary of P33,000 for medical employees in government and in the private sector.,The current salary grade 1 is P13,000 for government health-care workers, said Dr. Frederick Mars Untalan, president of the Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center (BGHMC) Employees Association. Public health-care workers include nurses, medical technicians, skilled workers in allied medical fields and administrative support personnel, according to health and government budget circulars.,“Is that sufficient as a monthly living wage? That’s the only relevant question,” Untalan said in Filipino.,At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, budget officials no longer applied salary grade 1 to entry-level nurses.,The unity walk from the city’s Post Office Loop in downtown Baguio to BGHMC was organized by the 2-year-old Coalition of Health Workers Organizations in the Cordillera in time for this year’s National Health Workers Day.,In a statement, the coalition said it was pushing forward “the pressing demands for just compensation and benefits, job security and an end to poor working conditions.”,The unity walk also advocated for the passage of a second magna carta that raises the pay and benefits of private sector health workers which was introduced in 2019 and again in 2022 by the Makabayan bloc in Congress and by Cebu Rep. Eduardo Rama Jr. in 2023.,The coalition urged the Department of Health (DOH) and the Baguio government to raise public health-care funding and increase medical infrastructure, stressing that it was “crucial for the government to acknowledge that health care is a fundamental human right and allocate resources accordingly.”,The BGHMC is in the middle of a construction boom as it builds new medical facilities.,“The pandemic has underscored the deficiencies in our public health system, exposing both health workers and patients to grave risks,” the coalition pointed out.,It added: “The scarcity of protective equipment, persistent understaffing and budgetary constraints have left health workers susceptible to [hazards like workplace] infections and burnout.”,Securing a P33,000 entry salary across the board is also important because it may encourage new blood in the medical sector to work in the country, instead of aspiring for overseas jobs, said Judith Magwilang, governor of the Philippine Nurses Association (PNA) in the Cordillera.,She said Congress had once given the health-care community only one option: to raise the salary of either government or private medical workers.,Addressing the students of different medical schools in Baguio, Magwilang said PNA and many health-care organizations opted for a hike in the starting salary of public and private hospital workers instead, “so you won’t decide to work abroad.”,Untalan outlined health-care workers’ rights under Republic Act No. 7305 (the 1993 Magna Carta for Public Health Workers), including the right to be consulted regarding all public health policies set by the government.,He said health-care workers must be “agents of change,” because high-level government officials rarely know the concerns of employees at the bottom of the ladder and it was their job to “make them understand.”,Untalan said even information technology specialists required by government hospitals are being lured abroad because of a comparatively lower salary in government.,Mayor Benjamin Magalong joined the group and advised them to continue speaking out because what they achieve would improve the lives of future health-care workers.,“Silence will become a more powerful tool for corrupt government politicians and corrupt national government officials” whose actions affect public health programs, he said.,Magalong said government corruption had eroded all progress made in governance.,“We need to speak up,” he said, stressing that by not doing so, “our negligence will be felt by our young health-workers.”,The Cordillera is served by 8,387 health workers, according to a 2015 DOH report.,In a 2022 field health services technical report, the DOH said the ratio of doctors to population (projected to rise to 1,836,857 in 2022) fulfilled the standard 1:20,000 population ratio “with 109 doctors covering around 16,852 individuals per doctor.”,“The ratio of nurse to population in [the Cordillera was] significantly lower than the ideal ratio of 1:10,000 population,” the report said.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1938619/baguio-health-care-workers-seek-p33000-entry-pay

Consequently, some Palestinian families lumbered out under chilly spring rain, witnesses said.,The Israeli army said about 100,000 are being evacuated from east Rafah.,A senior official of Hamas, the militant Palestinian group that governs Gaza, said the evacuation order was a “dangerous escalation that will have consequences.”,“The US administration, alongside the occupation, bears responsibility for this terrorism,” the official, Sami Abu Zuhri, said, referring to Israel’s alliance with Washington.,Israel’s military said it had begun encouraging residents of Rafah to evacuate in a “limited scope” operation.

Highly-educated Filipinos as OFWs: A double-edged sword for PH,Cristina Eloisa Baclig," , / 10:09 AM May 09, 2024","MANILA, Philippines — In a world that’s constantly on the move, the Philippines has carved out a unique position as a powerhouse in the export of skilled labor. Every year, waves of Filipinos pack their bags to set out across the globe, driven by the pursuit of brighter futures and better opportunities.,This mass migration, while opening doors for many, wields a double-edged sword: it propels Filipino talent onto the world stage, filling crucial roles in international industries, yet it simultaneously strains the local workforce, especially in critical sectors such as health care and education.,These workers, known as Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs), are not just employees abroad; they are the lifeline of their homeland. Their remittances are the financial bedrock for countless families and a vital cog in the machinery of the Philippine economy.,However, this exodus of talent also brings to light the concerning issue of ‘brain drain,’ leaving the nation in a perpetual struggle to replenish its pool of professionals.,This phenomenon is reshaping the Filipino identity on the global map, striking a balance between loss and gain, between the home left behind and the promise of the world beyond.,Despite its relatively small population of just over 100 million, the Philippines has made a significant impact on the world’s skilled workforce. With an impressive 1.89 million highly educated Filipinos residing in OECD countries, the country ranks third in the world for having the largest educated diaspora, falling behind only India with 3.12 million and China with 2.25 million.,The significance of the country’s contribution to the global pool of skilled workers becomes even more pronounced when considering the country’s much smaller population compared to India and China, both of which have populations exceeding a billion. India’s population stands at approximately 1.325 billion, while China’s is around 1.379 billion.,However, this success story is not without its challenges. The country faces a critical issue: a high percentage of its highly educated workforce is emigrating abroad.,In recent years, the number of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) has continued to grow, with data from the Philippine Statistics Authority showing a steady increase from 1,825,000 in 2021 to 1,963,000 in 2022. These numbers represent a significant proportion of the country’s workforce, engaging in a diverse array of occupations across the globe.,Of the Filipinos returning from overseas, data from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) revealed that 49.6 percent have some college education or higher, reflecting the level of education many choose to take abroad.,This phenomenon is more pronounced in the Philippines compared to countries like India, where the emigration rate of educated individuals is minimal despite its vast population. This raises concerns about the sustainability of the country’s workforce development.,It is essential to note that while other countries like the United Kingdom (1.75 million), Germany (1.47 million), Poland (1.20 million), Mexico (1.14 million), and Russia (1.06 million) also supply skilled migrants, the situation in the Philippines is particularly striking.,The country’s departure of a significant portion of its skilled and educated workforce highlights its crucial role in the global marketplace. It also underscores the potential challenges to its workforce development and sustainability.,According to data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) for 2022, Asia remains the predominant destination for OFWs, accounting for 80.8 percent of the Filipino workforce abroad. This substantial proportion reflects the longstanding ties and geographic proximity that facilitate labor migration within the region.,The Middle East is another crucial employment hub, with Saudi Arabia hosting 23.0 percent of OFWs alone. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait also significantly contribute, with 13.7 percent and 7.7 percent respectively.,These regions depend on the diverse skill set of OFWs, particularly in sectors such as health care, construction, and domestic services, where their hard work and adaptability are highly valued.,In addition to Asia and the Middle East, other parts of the world also draw Filipino talent. Europe accounts for 9.0 percent of OFWs, while North and South America collectively make up 6.3 percent, with countries like the United States and Canada becoming increasingly popular due to higher wages, better living conditions, and opportunities for family reunification.,These nations, known for their multicultural makeup, provide a supportive environment for Filipinos, helping to foster a sense of community and belonging far from home.,This significant presence of OFWs across various regions highlights their integral role in the global workforce. It sets the stage for a deeper exploration into the impact of their financial contributions, mainly through remittances, on both their host countries and the Philippines.,In 2023, remittances from OFWs continued to play a pivotal role in the Philippine economy, highlighting the significant financial contributions of Filipinos working abroad.,According to data from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), remittances reached an all-time high, with cash remittances alone amounting to $33.491 billion for the year. This marked a growth of 2.9 percent over the previous year, underscoring the resilience of OFWs’ financial contributions despite global economic uncertainties.,December 2023 saw a notable increase in remittances, with a 3.8 percent rise to $3.28 billion compared to the same period in 2022, reflecting the seasonal trend of increased remittance flows during the holiday season.,This boost was largely attributed to the contributions from both land-based and sea-based workers, demonstrating the ongoing commitment of OFWs to support their families back home during significant times of the year.,The United States, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, and Japan were among the leading sources of these remittances, pointing to the diverse global footprint of the Filipino workforce. The steady flow of funds from these countries not only supports individual families but also plays a crucial role in stabilizing the Philippine peso and bolstering the country’s economic growth.,Projected trends suggest that remittances will continue to grow, with an expected increase of 3 percent in the forthcoming years. The data showed that OFWs continue to send financial support back home, ensuring a robust economic connection with their homeland.,This steady stream of funds not only aids individual family members but also plays a crucial role in maintaining the economic stability of the Philippines.,As the Philippine government acknowledges the profound impact of brain drain on national development, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has proposed a new strategy aimed at retaining local talent.,The strategy involves enticing graduates, particularly from the health and information technology sectors, to serve in the Philippines before moving abroad.,READ: ,“We have to come up with some kind of strategy wherein, let’s say, you provide scholarships, and then the scholarship agreement includes that you stay three years. After that, then they’re free to go,” Marcos said,This initiative is complemented by the acknowledgment that while Filipino graduates are free to seek opportunities abroad, the loss of trained professionals could be mitigated by such programs.,According to Marcos, these efforts need to be supported by more attractive local employment options that could compete with international offers.,In support of this strategy, the Private Sector Advisory Council’s Jobs Sector Group (PSAC-Jobs) has highlighted that the local market struggles to match the high salaries offered in countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Europe.,“I think what we can do is to continue to offer certificate programs and train their skills. I think we can do that. There’s no way for us to retain them,” said Teresita Sy-Coson of SM Investments Corp.,The PSAC has also urged a more coordinated approach among government agencies—including the Department of Health (DOH), the Commission on Higher Education (CHEd), and the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW)—to create more compelling opportunities for Filipino workers.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1938802/highly-educated-filipinos-as-ofws-a-double-edged-sword-for-ph
