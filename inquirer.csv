They were satisfied I would say,” Ejercito said.,“Ako masasabi ko sa kanila walang naging kasalanan si Migz Zubiri sa inyo bilang Senate President.

Environmental groups’ call: Save trees on path of Davao-Samal bridge,Germelina Lacorte," , / 05:15 AM May 23, 2024","DAVAO CITY, Philippines — Environmentalists here are alarmed that hundreds of trees are being cut down to give way to the China-funded bridge project that will connect this city to nearby Samal Island.,Carmela Marie Santos, head of the environment group Ecoteneo and secretariat of Sustainable Davao Movement (SDM), said they were surprised to see the signage put up by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) telling the public that it had issued a permit for the cutting of 223 trees in the Davao City side alone for the Samal Island-Davao City Connector (SIDC) project.,Santos, who addressed the city council session on Tuesday, said that Davao City, one of the 38 cities in the country that the state weather bureau said would continue to experience “dangerous” heat index levels, was supposed to be planting more trees, not cutting them.,“This [year] was greeted with the alarming heat levels that have been accompanied by a [suspension] of classes across the country, dismal effects on agriculture productivity and serious health risks for the vulnerable. Yet, here in our city, [the] DPWH (Department of Public Works and Highways) brings in Chinese contractors cutting trees by the hundreds and clearing areas by the hectares for a bridge that is only less than 3 kilometers,” said the position paper signed by environment groups that included Ecoteneo of the Ateneo de Davao University and the Interfacing Development Interventions for Sustainability (Idis).,Lawyer Romeo Cabarde, director of Ateneo Public Interest and Legal Advocacy (Apila), said they were greatly disappointed that the city government allowed the cutting of trees despite a local ordinance that protects heritage trees from being cut.,Cabarde said they were exhausting all means to negotiate with the local government but if their efforts would fail, then they would file a writ of kalikasan to prevent the further destruction of trees and the environment and its adverse impact on the lives of communities who depend on them.,The cutting of another 200 trees on Samal Island has also started to pave the way for the start of SIDC construction.,“Were Davao citizens consulted on this matter? Did they observe the Heritage Tree Ordinance and apply for a permit from the Office of the Mayor?” Santos asked, referring to the city ordinance that protects mature trees, particularly centennial trees and those that form part of a tree corridor in the area.,Aside from calling for the suspension of tree-cutting and land clearing activities, the group also urged the local government to declare a climate emergency and a moratorium on all major projects in the city that would damage protected and ecologically sensitive areas.,“We look at the cutting of trees not only as an environmental tragedy but also as a serious human rights violation,” Cabarde said.,“It’s a dangerous [thinking]for the city council to say that we can’t do anything because it’s a national project,” said lawyer Mark Peñalver, Idis executive director. “So what can the local government do in the face of national government projects that have adverse impact on communities?”",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1943728/environmental-groups-call-save-trees-on-path-of-davao-samal-bridge

A second source said the drills did not officially exist and were dubbed “unplanned sea encounters,” pointing to a tacit agreement in which both sides claim the exercises were simply the result of coincidental encounters.,“It’s like I am dining in this restaurant and you also happen to be here,” the source said. “Then it looks like I am only sharing the same table with someone.”,That source also said about half a dozen navy ships from both sides, including frigates and supply and support vessels, participated in the dayslong exercises, which were designed to practice “basic” operations such as communications, refueling and resupply.,Taiwan’s navy said in a statement to Reuters that to handle unexpected scenarios at sea and to minimize “interference” with each another, the navy “acts in concert with the US-promoted Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea,” also known as CUES.,“The Navy often makes contact with vessels of other countries and conducts encounter drills as needed,” the statement said, without elaborating.,The Pentagon declined to comment.,Taiwan and the United States have no official diplomatic relationship, as Washington formally recognizes Beijing but is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself and is the island’s most important international backer.,A third source said although the “unplanned encounters” of the two navies involved mostly basic exercises, such drills are vital to ensure the two militaries can operate together in times of emergency.,The source added that the two navies also practiced various tactical maneuvers, including searching for underwater targets.,The CUES was formulated about a decade ago to help deescalate tensions between militaries at sea, providing guidelines such as safe speeds and distances, a common communications language, and what actions to take if a ship becomes disabled.,China’s foreign ministry repeated its opposition to military ties between the United States and Taiwan, urging the United States to stop its “erroneous acts” of military collusion with Taiwan, and warning Taiwan authorities that seeking independence by force and resisting “reunification” would fail.,China’s defense ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.,Taiwan’s navy chief, Tang Hua, last month visited the United States and discussed how to boost bilateral naval cooperation, Reuters reported. In response, China’s foreign ministry said it firmly opposed “military collusion” between the United States and Taiwan.,This month, Taiwan’s chief of the general staff Adm. Mei Chia-shu attended the change-of-command ceremony for US Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii, which only came to light after he was spotted in the audience in an official picture.,China has long said Taiwan is China’s most sensitive territorial issue, which is a major bone of contention in Sino-US ties.,Beijing has not renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, while Taipei says the Chinese territorial claims are void as the People’s Republic of China has never governed the island. —Reuters",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1940634/us-taiwan-navies-hold-pacific-drills

Felimon Espares had recommended a 60-day suspension for the Davao del Norte congressman, the penalty was reduced to a censure on the prompting of Camiguin Rep. Jurdin Jesus Romualdo.,Romualdo was among the lawmakers who reacted strongly against Alvarez’s statements in the April 14 Maisug prayer rally at the Davao del Norte Sports and Tourism complex. He even called on the Department of Justice to investigate and possibly file a complaint of inciting to sedition against the former House leader.,A total of 186 lawmakers voted in favor of the committee’s recommendation. Five were not in favor, while seven abstained, including Senior Deputy Majority Leader Sandro Marcos, the President’s son.,Espares said that although Alvarez propounded specific defenses, “we cannot agree that there was no improper conduct committed,” adding that the committee “cannot countenance such words or statements that would put into disrepute the image of our institution.”,“Our colleague should have been more circumspect [about] his words or statements and observed the norms of conduct expected of public officials under our jurisdiction,” he stressed.,He said the panel found that the former Speaker “indeed uttered unparliamentary and inappropriate statements which reflected negatively upon the dignity, integrity and reputation of the House as an institution and on the members of the House individually and collectively.”,In appealing to downgrade the penalty, Romualdo said that while he agreed that Alvarez’s statements in the rally were “unparliamentary and distasteful,” the committee had acknowledged that they were “emotional expressions rather than intentional calls for actual harm or further political consequences.”,Romualdo also said the severity of a 60-day suspension appeared “disproportionate” to the nature and context of the former Speaker’s conduct.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1943764/house-censures-alvarez-for-urging-govt-troops-to-turn-back-on-marcos
SC rules client’s death can’t be blamed on gym,," , / 05:48 AM May 23, 2024","MANILA, Philippines — The Supreme Court has absolved a fitness center of liability over the death of its 59-year-old client after a workout session in 2000.,In a decision promulgated on April 3 but made public only on Tuesday, the high tribunal’s First Division ruled that Miguel Kim, the husband of deceased Adelaida Kim, failed to establish that Slimmers World International violated the terms of its contract with his wife and that there was a causal connection between her final training session and death.,The court noted that neither the member’s handout nor the records showed that the gym had an obligation to take the client’s blood pressure and to have a doctor onsite at all times.,“To be sure, the Court cannot hold the fitness center accountable for terms that do not exist in the contract,” it said in the ruling penned by Associate Justice Jose Midas Marquez.,The Supreme Court effectively granted the petition for review on certiorari filed by Slimmers World as it reversed the 2012 decision of the Court of Appeals, which found the gym guilty of breaching its obligation.,It also dismissed for lack of merit, Miguel’s complaint for recovery of damages for the death of his wife.,The case stemmed from a case filed by Miguel in 2000 after his wife died due to cerebral hemorrhage and severe hypertension.,Adelaida, then 59 years old, had availed herself of the 12-visit personal training program of Slimmers World.,Shortly after her 12th session, she complained of a headache and vomited. The gym staff immediately brought her to the hospital but she died after three days.,In a 2009 decision, a local court granted Miguel’s complaint for damages, finding that the gross negligence of Slimmers World, its managing director, and Adelaida’s fitness trainer was the proximate cause of her death.,The gym and its two personnel were ordered to pay a total of P1.3 million in damages and attorney’s fees.,The appellate court affirmed the lower court’s decision in 2012 but reduced the award of moral and exemplary damages from P500,000 and P200,000 to P50,000 each. It also removed the attorney’s fees for “lack of basis.”,In ruling on the present petition, the Supreme Court said that the gym “can neither be held answerable for contractual negligence nor quasi-delict.”,Quasi-delict is defined as “fault or negligence if there is no pre-existing contractual relation[ship] between the parties.”,The high court underscored that when Adelaida availed herself of the 12-visit program, she “expressly declared” in her application that she was not suffering from hypertension, among others.,“Notably, Adelaida made these declarations despite her duty to ‘inform the Fitness Trainer of any medical problem or concern before engaging in any gym activity,’” the Supreme Court said.,“In the final analysis, while the Court commiserates with Miguel for the death of his wife, it is the solemn duty of this Court to impartially assess the merits of the case on applicable law and evidence adduced,” the court said.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1943775/sc-rules-clients-death-cant-be-blamed-on-gym

The crisis poses a severe threat to our water supply, impacting both our daily lives and the environment,” CCGeo warned on Wednesday.,CCGeo said that extreme temperatures could have likely “significantly impacted the water levels in the Taguibo watershed.”,“Prolonged periods of high temperatures in the area over the past months likely led to increased evaporation rates; it may have reduced the surface water available in the [Taguibo] dam. This issue is further exacerbated by insufficient rainfall to replenish the water supply. These recent extreme temperatures have likely accelerated the drying up of the dam and other parts of the watershed, contributing to the overall water crisis,” it added.,CCGeo urged Butuan residents “to conserve water in our daily usage, support efforts to restore and protect our watershed and advocate for sustainable water management practices.”,Pagasa noted that Butuan City and six other areas in the country had registered a heat index of 45 to 46 degrees Celsius as of May 21.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1943726/butuan-city-under-calamity-state-due-to-water-crisis

Make it open to the people and ensure the true and correct purpose of the project,” Gilig added.,MV Hyperline 988, a vessel with a Philippine flag but registered in Sierra Leone, was detained by the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) in the waters off this town on May 15 following the discovery of 21 “basic deficiencies.”,The PCG said 13 of these deficiencies were grounds for detention, like the absence of statutory certificates and garbage and oil record books.,According to Commander Euphraim Jayson Diciano, head of the PCG station in Zambales, the vessel will remain detained pending the submission of its permits and other documents related to its purpose in docking here.,Diciano said the ship owner must report to the PCG within 10 days of being notified about the deficiencies.,“After the PCG station evaluates all circumstances in light of the ship owner’s explanations, it will resolve the matter and send the report to inspectors for further assessment before releasing it,” he said.,Diciano noted that the decision regarding the release of MV Hyperline 988 was no longer under the jurisdiction of the PCG. Instead, it would be up to the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency to make the decision.,“However, concerns with other agencies pertaining to national security are influencing the PCG’s decision on Hyperline 988’s release,” he said, without elaborating.,In March, at least 17 vessels registered in the Philippines but owned by China Harbour Engineering Co. Ltd., carried out dredging activities here.,But these vessels were eventually held at the Manila anchorage area by the Maritime Safety Services Command of the PCG after also finding some deficiencies.,“This is a big insult to us Filipinos. While our fellow fishermen are driven away by the Chinese coast guard from our territory, we’re being lenient to Chinese workers who are here illegally,” said Gilig.,The Inquirer tried to reach Gov. Hermogenes Ebdane Jr. and San Felipe Mayor Reinhard Jeresano for comment on the possible resumption of the dredging operations but they were not immediately available.,In 2019, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) issued Administrative Order No. 13 rationalizing the dredging activities in the heavily silted river channels of Bucao in Botolan, Maloma in San Felipe, and Sto. Tomas traversing the towns of San Marcelino, San Narciso and San Felipe.,Local officials and the DENR have been conducting public consultations for the continuation of dredging operations in some coastal areas of the province.,But affected residents had mounted a series of protests opposing the dredging operation and the presence of Chinese workers in the town, forcing the provincial govern ment to suspend the project,Sen. Jinggoy Estrada, chair of the Senate committee on national defense, filed a resolution on May 15 seeking to investigate the dredging activities of Chinese vessels in the province.,According to Estrada, the activities affect the livelihood of residents, cause undue damage to the environment and impact tourism.,The senator also inspected this town in March and was able to talk to some of the residents who protested against the dredging activities.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1943729/detained-ship-chinese-crew-still-in-zambales
