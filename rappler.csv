Heavy rain looms as LPA likely to become Aghon,Acor Arceo,"May 23, 2024 2:35 PM PHT","MANILA, Philippines – The weather bureau warned of potentially heavy rain in the coming days as the low pressure area (LPA) that it has been monitoring entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) at around 5 am on Thursday, May 23.,As of 10 am, the LPA was located 870 kilometers east of southeastern Mindanao, according to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA).,The LPA is seen to develop into a tropical depression within 24 hours, or by Friday morning, May 24.,It will be given the local name ,Aghon, as the Philippines’ first tropical cyclone for 2024.,PAGASA said in a briefing on Thursday that the LPA or potential Aghon could move generally northwest until Saturday, May 25, then recurve northeast by Sunday, May 26.,That means the weather disturbance might remain offshore or over the Philippine Sea, but PAGASA also warned that it could still be near landmass. In particular, it may be nearest the Bicol-Eastern Visayas area on Saturday.,PAGASA Weather Specialist Ana Clauren-Jorda added that landfall is not being ruled out, given what the weather bureau describes as the “high” uncertainty in the LPA’s track for the first 48 hours.,The track can still change due to the “broad circulation of the disturbance right now,” PAGASA said.,On Thursday, the trough or extension of the LPA may already trigger light to heavy rain in Surigao del Norte, Surigao del Sur, and Dinagat Islands.,On Friday, Eastern Samar and Northern Samar could have moderate to heavy rain, while Bicol, Caraga, and the rest of Eastern Visayas may see light to moderate rain.,By Saturday, or when the potential Aghon would be nearest the Bicol-Eastern Visayas area, moderate to intense rain is possible in Catanduanes, Camarines Sur, and Northern Samar. Light to moderate rain is also expected in Quezon including Polillo Islands, the rest of Bicol, and the rest of Eastern Visayas.,Science and Technology Secretary Renato Solidum Jr. called on local government units and the public to prepare for the effects of rainfall., Solidum said during Thursday’s briefing.,(We need to take precautions for possible floods and landslides in areas that may experience heavy rain.),For strong winds, tropical cyclone wind signals could be raised as early as Friday for parts of Bicol and Eastern Visayas.,In terms of intensity, the weather disturbance may strengthen into a tropical storm by Sunday morning, and then as it recurves, into a severe tropical storm by Tuesday, May 28.,The arrival of the LPA or Aghon does not automatically mean the start of the Philippines’ rainy season, which is usually declared in the second half of May or first half of June.,PAGASA Deputy Administrator for Research and Development Marcelino Villafuerte II explained that none of the 13 stations being monitored for amount of rainfall have met the criteria yet.,These stations are also in the western part of the country, while the LPA or Aghon will mostly affect the eastern portion, based on the initial forecast.,Aghon may pull the southwesterly windflow, which would affect the western part of the country, but it remains to be seen if the stations would meet the rainfall criteria. For now, the ,warm and dry season, is still winding down.,El Niño, also continues to weaken and a transition to neutral conditions is expected. But there is a 60% chance of La Niña developing in the June-August period.,According to Villafuerte, 13 to 16 tropical cyclones may form within or enter PAR in 2024. There were 11 tropical cyclones in 2023. ",https://www.rappler.com/nation/weather/low-pressure-area-update-pagasa-forecast-may-23-2024-1130am/

We all know Ginebra is ‘never say die,’ that has always been their mantra. You saw they did not give up,” said Meralco head coach Luigi Trillo. ,Fans rooting for Ginebra went for the exits with over four minutes remaining as the Bolts looked on the way to a blowout after mounting an 83-66 advantage. ,That sizable lead, however, slowly vanished, with the Gin Kings riding on a 14-2 run powered by Nards Pinto, Von Pessumal, and LA Tenorio to inch within 80-85 with 25 seconds remaining. ,A pair of missed free throws from Meralco forward Alvin Pasaol kept the comeback door ajar for Ginebra, but Tenorio missed a long three-pointer and David Murrell put too much force on his putback as the Bolts escaped with the victory. ,Trillo said his wards need to be on their toes from start to finish, whether they are leading or trailing. ,“We were shooting our shots that last four, five minutes with 15, 17 seconds [on the shot clock]. Our players should not do that, they should know how to manage the time, they should be in their proper spacing.

San Miguel is a class organization. We’re friends with their coaching staff and their bosses over there. That is just a minimum requirement for respect. There is no quotient in the semis,” said Guiao in a mix of Filipino and English. ,“Terrence is not a new player. I’m sure he knows that.” ,Romeo finished with 13 points on 6-of-16 shooting – needing to work for every bucket as the Elasto Painters’ guards hounded him.,At one point, Romeo incurred a technical foul for second motion after being pestered by Rain or Shine rookie Adrian Nocum during an inbound play.,It was Romeo, though, who brought San Miguel home by scoring 7 of their last 10 points, including the three-pointer that infuriated Guiao. ,For Guiao, disrespect invites disrespect. ,“I got angry. I lost my temper,” said Guiao. “You do not want to be rude, but if you’re being disrespected, you do not want to be bullied.” ,“Nothing untoward happened before that. Nothing happened that would justify what he did. There are just people who are rude. We cannot do anything about it. There are people who are arrogant and rude.” ,Guiao said he expected better from a player that belongs to a storied franchise like the Beermen, who are eyeing a record-extending 30th championship. ,“I think the mere fact that they’re seeded No. 1, they’re the best team, they have the best record, they have the best talent, that in itself should make them a class organization. And part of being a class organization is giving due respect to those who are below your level,” said Guiao.,On the brink of elimination, the Elasto Painters look to stay alive by winning Game 4 on Friday, May 24, at the Mall of Asia Arena.

Philippines says China to blame for ‘choppy’ bilateral ties  ,Bea Cupin,"May 22, 2024 2:30 PM PHT","MANILA, Philippines – As a Senate panel probed the ,wiretapping, of a call between a Philippine naval commander and a Chinese diplomat, on Wednesday, May 22, Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo described the current state of bilateral relations between Manila and Beijing as “a bit choppy.” ,“I would say they’re a bit choppy. There are many issues which have come up recently. But mainly…it’s really been an effort by the Philippines to assert our rights in our exclusive economic zone in the West Philippine Sea and this assertion is based on rights which are granted by international law…. So that’s all that the Philippines has been doing, is doing, and will continue to do,” said Manalo in a briefing with select Philippine media. ,Manalo, a career diplomat who has helmed the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) since President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. took office, said it was China’s “illegal” actions in the ,West Philippine Sea, that are to blame for the rising tensions. ,“China has continued to harass our fishermen, try and ,block our efforts, to resupply our military personnel in Ayungin Shoal and also our fishermen in Scarborough Shoal. So these actions are and have been inconsistent and, in fact, are illegal in the sense that they are not consistent with international law,” said Manalo. ,“These actions have been a cause for raising tensions. We’re merely trying to assert our rights. And unfortunately, we are being hampered in doing so. In my personal belief, this is creating the tensions,” he added. ,Manalo made the statement when asked to describe bilateral ties with Beijing, over two years into the Marcos administration. ,The West Philippine Sea refers to a part of the South China Sea that includes the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ). China claims a large part of the South China Sea as its own, despite a ,2016 arbitral ruling, that invalidated its 9-dash turned 10-dash claim. ,Ayungin Shoal, (Second Thomas Shoal) and Panatag Shoal (Scarborough Shoal or Bajo de Masinloc) have been flashpoints for tensions between Manila and Beijing in the West Philippine Sea. China, mainly through its China Coast Guard (CCG), routinely harasses Filipino fisherfolk and block Philippine government missions to bring supplies to a military outpost in Ayungin Shoal and aide to fisherfolk in Panatag Shoal. ,In March, two military resupply missions to Ayungin Shoal, where a rusting warship serves as a military outpost, were ,met with the CCG’s strong water cannons,. In late April 2024, the CCG also used water cannons against Philippine government vessels that were trying to patrol Panatag Shoal and bring supplies to fisherfolk in the area.,“We will continue to assert our rights in the appropriate way. And of course, it’s not only the Department of Foreign Affairs. This is a government-wide effort. But the President [has made] very clear that it is our priority to assert our national sovereignty, especially where it’s justified,” said Manalo. ,Tensions between the two Asian countries have spilled over to diplomacy and politics, with the two countries trading barbs over alleged deals and ,supposed reneging of agreements, in the West Philippine Sea. ,Manalo said ,no such agreement exists,. “I’ve never seen those agreements. They say they’re agreements. But where? Show us. And I don’t recall ever having discussed proposals to have such agreements,” he said. ,The foreign secretary added that he doesn’t expect ties with China to “downgrade” despite rising tensions in the West Philippine Sea. “We’ve always agreed that we should try and manage our relationship, manage our disputes through diplomatic means and through peaceful means, and this includes through meetings,” said Manalo. ,The Philippines and Beijing are set to convene the Bilateral Consultation Mechanism on the South China Sea for a second time in 2024, with Manila as host. Manalo said a final date was being ironed out. ,“We have to have an understanding on how we can manage our relationship without increasing tensions. But then, I think, in many ways, China is not really helping us to do so. That’s the challenge because of the many incidents that are occurring. So that’s a challenge for us how to do that. But we are still definitely committed to seeking diplomatic means to manage our tensions,” he added.

"Agreements and disagreements on the West Philippine Sea, explained ",Bea Cupin,"May 22, 2024 9:00 AM PHT","MANILA, Philippines – From a promise to ,ride a jetski to the West Philippine Sea, that turned into policies that ,bended to Beijing’s will,, then a vow to be a “friend to all” that turned into a declaration that “,Filipinos do not yield,,” the Philippines has seen dramatic shifts in its policy and approach to handling our superpower neighbor China. ,Manila’s new-found vigor in the West Philippine Sea, at least initially, seemed to perplex Beijing. Former president Rodrigo Duterte, after all, promised a “pivot” to China. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. now promises to work with China when interests align, but to “push back…[if] jurisdiction in the West Philippine Sea are questioned or ignored.” ,Beijing’s own push back – amid the Philippine government’s “transparency initiative” in the West Philippine Sea – has mostly come in the form of belated “revelations,” piecemeal claims of agreements, and even a threat to release a supposed audio recording of a phone call between a Chinese diplomat and a Philippine general. ,We trace the deals and agreements on the West Philippine Sea, beginning 2012, when the Philippines and China’ tense stand-off in Scarborough or Panatag Shoal led to the eventual filing of a pleading with a United Nations-backed arbitral tribunal. ,That pleading would result in the 2016 Arbitral Award, made public in the first weeks of the Duterte administration. ,On April 8, 2012, a Philippine Navy (PN) surveillance plane monitored Chinese vessels fishing inside the lagoon of Scaborough Shoal or Panatag Shoal, an atoll located some 120 nautical miles off the coast of mainland Zambales. ,The Philippines then sent a warship, the BRP ,, to conduct more surveillance on the Chinese ships. On April 10, according to a , report, soldiers from the , boarded and inspected the vessels. “Large amounts of illegally collected corals, giant clams, and live sharks were found inside the compartments of the first fishing vessel that was boarded by the PN team,” said the Department of Foreign Affairs then. ,Two Chinese “maritime surveillance ships” then entered the lagoon, preventing Philippine forces from arresting the fishermen, and a standoff commenced. The United States, a treaty ally of the Philippines, ,brokered an agreement, to pull out government vessels from the shoal – which Manila said Beijing did not follow. China denies a deal was ever made. ,Beijing has occupied and maintained practical control of the shoal and its lagoon since then. According to the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), six to eight Chinese vessels stay in and around  the shoal at all times. Deployment increased dramatically in mid-May 2024 during a civilian-led mission to the vicinity of the shoal. ,China claims a huge part of the South China Sea as its own. It’s a claim that overlaps with several countries in the region, including the Philippines. ,Mere weeks into Rodrigo Duterte’s administration in July 2016, the Arbitral Tribunal announced its ruling, which deemed China’s broad claim on the South China Sea invalid, and affirmed the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone. ,But under Duterte – the same president who promised to plant the Philippine flag on features in the West Philippine Sea via jetski – the Philippines did not make a deal over what would have been a game-changing victory. ,Duterte’s main, sometimes solitary, goal in the West Philippine Seam was to secure the safety of civilians – the inhabitants of Pagasa (Thitu) Island, and fisherfolk who rely on features like Scaborough Shoal (Panatag Shoal or Bajo de Masinloc) for their livelihoods. ,Duterte’s discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping focused on keeping the status quo in the West Philippine Sea. This has meant that the Philippines could and would not build new things on features it already occupies, nor would it seek out new features to occupy. An exemption was Pagasa Island, located beyond the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone, where a civilian population resides. ,In turn, China reportedly agreed not to build in Scarborough Shoal while also not impeding resupply missions to Ayungin Shoal – as long as construction materials were not in the mix. ,China uses the term “gentleman’s agreement” to refer to their Duterte-era deals with the Philippines. The term is usually used with respect to Ayungin Shoal. ,The Marcos administration denies any knowledge of the agreement, although China insists its officials were briefed about it.   ,The supposed “gentleman’s agreement” is the subject of an inquiry at the House of Representatives, a chamber dominated by a supermajority allied with the Marcos administration. ,Even before agreement under Duterte was made, Beijing had long bemoaned Manila’s alleged unfulfilled promise to tow away the BRP , from Ayungin Shoal. The warship was purposefully run aground on the shoal in 1999, also in response to China’s expansion in Mischief Reef, a feature close to mainland Palawan. ,Beijing brought up the so-called promise to tow the ship again in August 2023. Marcos denied the existence of an agreement, adding that “if there does exist such an agreement, I rescind that agreement as of now.” ,After going on about the “gentleman’s agreement” and how the Philippines supposedly reneged on it, the Chinese embassy in Manila introduced a new term: a “,new model,,” also concerning Ayungin Shoal, allegedly agreed upon under the Marcos administration.,The government’s top officials – from Marcos to Defense Secretary Gibo Teodoro to National Security Adviser Eduardo Año – denied making any such deal. China still insists it was made and agreed on by top security and defense officials, even threatening the release of a supposed recording of a phone call with former Western Command chief Vice Admiral Alberto Carlos where he allegedly confirmed the deal and his boss’ approval. ,Teodoro and Año have doubted the authenticity of the supposed recording, even as they’ve pointed out that recording a phone call without the consent of all parties is against Philippine law. The two top defense and security officials also floated the possibility of expelling Chinese diplomats involved in the alleged recording. ,The alleged wiretapping is now the subject of a Senate investigation. Carlos, now no longer Wescom chief, has been invited to the probe. Chinese Ambassador Huang Xilian has also been invited, although he cannot be compelled to attend the Congressional probe.

Sacked Wescom chief Carlos denies agreement with China in wiretapped call,Paterno R.

He admitted, however, that “we were exploring ways to reduce the tension.”,The sacked commander said he did not give his consent to record the conversation, and neither did he expect the phone call.,“I thought he was just going to greet me Happy New Year,” he said.

Escudero and the midnight chief justice,Marites Dañguilan Vitug,"May 23, 2024 8:00 AM PHT","Lawyer Francis “Chiz” Escudero, the new Senate president, may find it hard to live down his role in the appointment of a midnight chief justice in 2010 – a turbulent period in the annals of the judiciary that further politicized the Supreme Court.,Let’s look back at history, courtesy of the book ,.,Then-chief justice Reynato Puno was scheduled to retire on May 17, 2010, a day that fell within the election period. The Philippines was to hold its presidential election a week earlier, on May 10, 2010.,That meant that the post of chief justice would be vacant until a new president would appoint one.,Why was this so? The Constitution states in plain language (Article 7, Section 15): “Two months immediately before the next Presidential elections and up to the end of his term, a President or Acting President shall not make appointments, except temporary appointments to executive positions when continued vacancies therein will prejudice public or endanger public safety.”,President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo was ending her term – she served a total of nine years – and her allies were moving heaven and earth to enable her to appoint Puno’s replacement. Critics said she wanted to appoint a chief justice that she trusted because of the potential lawsuits that could hound her, stemming from allegations of corruption.,A stormy debate filled the airwaves as well as print and online media. Members of both houses of Congress joined the uproar against what became popularly called a “midnight appointment.” Lawyers’ groups were divided, but civil society watchdogs strongly protested the rush to appoint a chief justice.,The issue spilled over to the campaign. Presidential candidates Benigno Aquino III, Manuel Villar, and Gilberto Teodoro Jr. all opposed the “midnight appointment.”,The Judicial and Bar Council, the body that screens appointees to the courts, was divided. Puno chaired the JBC, which consisted of six members: representatives of the legal academe, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, and the private sector; a retired member of the Supreme Court; the justice secretary; and a member of the legislature.,Escudero sat in the JBC, representing the Senate since he was chair of the justice committee. At the time, he belonged to the opposition.,As the issue was raging, he declared with bravado in January 2010 that he was going to object to it. After the Supreme Court gave the go-signal to President Arroyo to name the new chief justice in March 2010, Escudero issued a statement, saying that “this decision is really a big disappointment because the law clearly states that the incumbent cannot appoint anyone within the period of the constitutional ban.”,What he said in public didn’t match his action. When crunch time came, Escudero voted with the allies of Arroyo to transmit the short list of chief justice nominees to the Office of the President, without delay.,On May 12, 2010, two days after election day and before a new president could be sworn in, Arroyo named Renato Corona to the post. He would be impeached more than a year later under the Aquino government.

5 things that don’t add up in Mayor Alice Guo’s Senate testimony,Bonz Magsambol,"May 22, 2024 9:05 PM PHT","MANILA, Philippines – Controversial Mayor Alice Guo of Bamban, Tarlac, faced the Senate for a second time  on Wednesday, May 22, as the chamber continued its probe into her supposed involvement in illegal Philippine offshore gaming operations (POGOs) in her province. ,But instead of giving answers, she left the Senate with more questions. ,“Is this mayor, who was born on a farm, taught by literally one person from Kinder to high school then didn’t go to college, a Chinese spy? A big time money-launderer? An enabler of scams and human trafficking? None of the above? One of the above? Or all of the above?” Deputy Minority Leader Risa Hontiveros rhetorically asked at the start of the hearing. ,Rappler lists down five things that don’t add up in Guo’s testimonies and in her answers during the four-hour-long Senate inquiry on Wednesday. ,Guo said in previous testimonies that she didn’t know her own siblings, named Sheila and Seimen Guo. But travel records from the Bureau of Immigration showed that they had traveled together at least thrice. ,The two siblings are also listed as Guo’s co-incorporators in a number of companies, such as QJJ Meat Shops Inc., 3LIN-Q farm Inc, QJJ Embroidery Center, Inc., QJJ Slaughter House, Inc., QSEED Genetics, Inc., RK-Land Development, Inc., and The Siopao Bulilits, Inc.,“Why would you lie to something like this that can easily be checked?” Hontiveros asked. ,Guo said she only lied about it to protect them. “,“,(The reason I would always answer “I don’t know” was because I didn’t want to implicate other people. They are private people.),In an exclusive interview with journalist Karen Davila on Monday, May 20, Guo said that she has paternal half-siblings. She claimed that she was a love child of Angelito Guo, a Chinese, and Amelia Leal, a Filipina who worked as a house help for Angelito’s wife. ,Hontiveros, however, was able to retrieve the birth certificates of the mayor and her supposed half-siblings, Sheila and Seimen. Their birth certificates indicate that they have the same mother, Amelia. ,“I note that the information contained in these documents is necessary to present in these hearings for the Senate to properly carry out its authority to conduct investigations and ferret out the truth behind these issues we are confronting, thus constituting an exception to the Data Privacy Act,” Hontiveros explained.,Hontiveros also flagged that Guo’s parents don’t have birth records. ,?” Hontiveros asked. ,(Angelito Guo and Amelia Leal don’t have birth records at all. So it will make you wonder, is it possible that Angelito Guo and Amelia Leal don’t even exist?),Guo claimed that her father Angelito is Chinese while her mother Amelia is Filipino. Eliezer Ambatali of the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) said that it’s possible that Amelia is not a real person.,(Is it possible that Amelia Leal is not a real person?) Senator Sherwin Gatchalian asked Ambatali. ,The resource person replied, ,(Possible).”,Hontiveros also revealed that there’s no marriage record available for Angelito and Amelia, contrary to what was indicated in the birth certificates of the Guo siblings. ,” Hontiveros said. ,(When I asked to check documents, there’s no record that Angelito Guo and Amelia Leal got married. That’s what our PSA certification tells us.),Guo claimed that she’s only an ordinary person despite living a luxurious lifestyle. ,At least 16 vehicles were under her name, and she owns different properties in the province, based on Hontiveros’ presentation.,Hontiveros said. (You’re insisting that you’re a simple person, but your Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth indicates that your assets run up to hundreds of millions of pesos.),The exact worth of Guo’s assets, as in dicated in her latest SALN, was not revealed during the hearing. ,Guo initially denied that she knew a certain Nancy Gamo, who was the representative of the raided POGO company ,Zun Yuan Technology Incorporated,. ,(I don’t know her), Your Honor,” Guo said, when asked about her relationship with Gamo. ,Unconvinced, Hontiveros said that Guo was lying. The senator said that Gamo was linked to all businesses under Guo’s name. This constituted a conflict of interest because since, as mayor, Guo was also the one approving business permits for Gamo.  ,Hontiveros said. ,(You were the approving authority for Zun Yuan because you were already a mayor at that time. Zun Yuan representative Nancy Gamo was involved in all your businesses.),The senator said that this could be a violation of the Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. ,Later on, Guo admitted that she knows Gamo. , she said. (Nancy Gamo was the one who prepared my documents from before.),Hontiveros said her committee had invited Gamo to attend the hearing, but she hadn’t reply yet. If she still wouldn’t appear in the next hearing, she would be subpoenaed, according to Hontiveros. ,Senators were probing Guo’s alleged involvement in the two illegal POGOs – Hongsheng Gaming Technology Incorporated and ,Zun Yuan Technology Incorporated,, located in the Baofu Compound. She admitted that she helped Hongsheng Gaming get the municipal council’s approval to operate in Bamban when she was still a private citizen. At the time, she owned half of Baofu. She claimed that she sold it just before she ran for mayor.,Things heated up as senators found out that surveillance activities and even the hacking of government websites were traceable to the raided POGO firms. But the controversial mayor insisted that she’s not a Chinese spy, she is a Filipino, and she will never leave Tarlac.  ,WATCH: Controversial Bamban Mayor Alice Guo has this to say after the Senate hearing: “Hindi po ako aalis ng Tarlac.

Miss Universe Philippines names representatives to 4 other int’l pageants ,Rappler.com,"May 23, 2024 2:16 AM PHT","MANILA, Philippines – After the crowning of ,Bulacan’s Chelsea Manalo, as Miss Universe Philippines 2024, the Miss Universe Philippines (MUPH) Organization named four other Filipina beauty queens as the country’s representatives in international pageants. ,Baguio’s Tarah Valencia was proclaimed Miss Supranational Philippines 2025 while Pampanga’s Cyrille Payumo was named Miss Charm Philippines 2025.,Meanwhile, Iloilo’s Alexie Mae Brooks was hailed Miss Eco International Philippines 2024 and Quezon Province’s Ma.

Philippine heat has always been a problem – and it’s going to get worse,Gaby Baizas,"May 18, 2024 8:30 AM PHT","Anna Dayola knows the Philippine heat all too well. ,Her daily three-hour commute is already grueling enough, but as a public school teacher, she also has to walk from one building to another inside the Parañaque National High School (PNHS) campus, leaving her short of breath every time. She sweats more easily, and she’s also prone to migraines, which, she said, the heat can aggravate.,Dayola takes pride in how the PNHS administration accommodates its students whenever it’s especially hot. The school recently scheduled all onsite classes in the morning, so everyone gets home by the time the heat is at its harshest in the afternoon. There is also consideration for students who need to take time off to recover until they’re healthy enough to attend in-person classes again.,But these adjustments can only do so much to alleviate the impact of this year’s ,excessive heat,.,“The academic calendar shift really is no joke, especially for public schools…. Sometimes, there are students who get dizzy spells, or they can’t come to school because they get asthma attacks or migraines. Sometimes, their parents tell them not to go to school if they already think the heat is going to be difficult to bear even before they leave the house,” Dayola said in Filipino.,While it feels like we’ve been experiencing hotter-than-normal days for the past few months, data from the last 10 years analyzed by Rappler showed that 2024’s heat index levels have actually been consistent with heat indices throughout the last decade – proof that Filipinos have long been bearing the brunt of extreme heat and the effects of climate change.,The extreme heat during this year’s dry season has been affecting Filipinos across the country, suspending classes, causing illnesses, and hurting people’s ,livelihoods, and the ,economy,. If global temperatures continue to rise by 2ºC, scientists said repeats of this year’s extreme heat can be ,expected every two to three years in the Philippines,, which may lead to various climate issues down the line.,“It is reasonable to expect that this type of heat will be the norm in the future because of rising global temperatures,” Gerry Bagtasa, professor at the Institute of Environmental Science and Meteorology at the University of the Philippines Diliman, said in an interview with Rappler. ,“There are various problems that we may face later on, like if ,crops, are unable to withstand higher temperatures, food storage can be a problem, or certain diseases become more prevalent due to higher temperatures.”,In the past couple of weeks, news and government reports have often cited the heat index, which refers to what people “,perceive or feel as the temperature affecting their body,.” It measures both the actual air temperature and relative humidity, which both contribute to the feeling of worsening heat. During the ,dry season,, which Filipinos often call “summer,” hotter days are expected.,PAGASA categorizes heat index levels based on its potential effects on the body:,Rappler looked at ,PAGASA heat index data, from the past 10 years, from 2014 to 2024. The analysis showed that previous dry seasons have also recorded high heat index levels above 52°C, which fall under the “extreme danger” category – similar to PAGASA’s analysis. Filipinos in areas with “extreme danger” heat index levels are likely to suffer from heat stroke if directly exposed to the sun.,Bagtasa defined heat index as a “measure of comfort” but added that there are other factors that influence how individual bodies perceive heat. These include the clothes we wear, the activities we’re doing, and whether or not we’re directly exposed to the sun.,Some areas are also more prone to excessive heat than others, according to climate experts. Factors that contribute to the heat in a given location include:,Because heat index takes both actual air temperature and relative humidity into consideration, Bagtasa explained that even a change in one of the parameters can lead to a change in the recorded heat index. A rise in relative humidity will make it more difficult for sweat to evaporate, contributing to a “stickier” and more uncomfortable feeling, even if the actual air temperature does not change.,Topography plays a role in how humid certain areas are. For instance, areas situated near bodies of water often record higher heat index levels.,“For example, Dagupan often records the highest heat index levels. Or Iba, Zambales, because Zambales is a coastal region. It’s hot because it’s next to the coast, and the humidity tends to be high. Dagupan is situated near Lingayen Gulf, where moisture from the West Philippine Sea enters,” Bagtasa explained in a mix of Filipino and English.,Dagupan, Pangasinan has consistently recorded high heat index levels during the dry season. Over the past decade, Dagupan recorded “extreme danger” levels of heat indices in seven different years. Heat indices in the area peaked at 53°C in 2017, 54°C in 2019 and 2020, 55°C in 2016 and 2022, 56°C in 2021, and 57°C in 2015. In 2024, Dagupan’s highest heat index was at 51°C, recorded on April 29.,Iba town in Zambales is typically not as hot as Dagupan, but it recorded the country’s highest heat index level in 2024 as of writing, at ,53°C, last April 28. This marked the first time that Iba’s heat index levels hit the “extreme danger” category over the past decade.,Elevation plays a part in temperatures and heat index levels, too. In an interview with Rappler, John Manalo of PAGASA’s Climatology and Agrometeorology Division explained that elevation and temperature are inversely related, which is why mountainous areas often see lower heat index levels.,“If you’ll notice, in Baguio, they don’t really experience high heat index levels. Of course, it’s because of their elevation, so they’ll experience lower temperatures…. The higher you are, like Malaybalay, or a mountain area, Tanay, the lower your temperatures are,” Manalo said in a mix of Filipino and English.,As opposed to the high heat indices of Dagupan and Iba, the three mountainous areas mentioned by Manalo experience much lower heat index levels. ,Baguio consistently recorded the lowest heat indices across PAGASA stations, just barely grazing the “caution” category. Tanay is slightly warmer, having hit the “danger” category only once in the past decade, in May 2017. Malaybalay also recorded low heat index levels throughout the last 10 years, but has also recorded heat indices in the “danger category” in five different years, including 2024.,While it’s common for PAGASA stations to record high heat index levels from March to May, Manalo said there are exceptions, as seen in Virac, Catanduanes, which, he said, may continue to see high heat indices until the “ber” ‘months.,This year’s excessive heat is also caused by the outgoing ,El Niño,, a climate pattern where eastern Pacific waters are warmer. This leads to fewer clouds being formed in the Philippines, which translates to fewer tropical cyclones and higher temperatures in the country. (READ: ,Is the Philippines prepared for El Niño?,),Bagtasa cited the ,2016 El Niño,, where parts of the Philippines also suffered from uncomfortable heat similar to that of this year’s. However, Manalo said that El Niño’s impacts on heat indices across the country aren’t consistent. El Niños may differ in ,magnitude,, and other climate patterns can also impact ,which areas will be affected.,For instance, droughts hit areas in ,Mindanao, in 2016, but it was areas in ,Luzon, that experienced droughts in 2024. From March to June 2016, there were a few instances when Malaybalay in Bukidnon – a typically cooler area – recorded higher heat indices than Iba, Zambales – a coastal area that’s usually more humid.,There’s also the issue of urbanization. Highly urbanized areas largely use materials such as concrete and asphalt, ,which hold more heat, and can lead to higher temperatures.,Scientists recently found, that this year’s heatwave in the Philippines would have been impossible without the ,climate crisis,. Earlier in 2024, PAGASA recorded its highest temperature yet in Metro Manila, where air temperature at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Pasay hit ,38.8°C, on April 27. This beat Metro Manila’s all-time record from over a century ago in 1915, when air temperature in the Port Area in Manila hit ,38.6ºC,.,Experts and activists have warned of worse to come, and have emphasized the need for authorities to prioritize climate resilience.,“Climate change is already staring us in the face. We’ve seen the tremendous impact that record-high temperatures have had on all Filipinos, especially on our most vulnerable sectors. The scenarios…of extreme heat becoming more intense and frequent as the climate crisis worsens are conditions that our current systems would simply not withstand,” Greenpeace Philippines campaigner Khevin Yu said in a statement.,The Philippines remains among the, countries most vulnerable to climate change,, which leads to extreme weather events and ,physical and mental health risks., Bleak climate projections have prompted experts and activists to call for urgent climate action.,For instance, teachers and other experts suggested making classrooms more climate-resilient, which may include improving ventilation and installing more drinking fountains.,“Hopefully, we get to address the issue of ventilation, and future buildings will be able to adapt to hot situations. It doesn’t make sense to add more buildings only to end up with poor ventilation. It’s not healthy,” Dayola said.,There are also increasing calls for countries to aggressively pursue ,just energy transition,. During the COP28 conference held in late 2023, over 100 nations agreed to ,triple renewable energy capacity by 2030,, signaling the ,“beginning of the end”, of the fossil fuel era.,Bagtasa brought up the possibility of investing in ,solar energy, to convert the heat into something practical, and governments even considering incentivizing it, just like how the ,Iloilo City government, did earlier this March.,Under the clean energy scenario in the ,Philippine Energy Plan, for 2020-2040, the government aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 12%. ,Business tycoons, in the country are also teaming up to invest in a facility for liquefied natural gas, seen as a ,“transition fuel” ,between coal and renewable energy sources.,Beyond calling on the Philippine government to “stop delaying the transition to renewable energy,” environment group Greepeace also urged the government to hold ,fossil fuel companies, accountable for their “disproportionate role in historical carbon emissions.”,“[The Philippine government] must scrap its plans for fossil gas expansion, and demand payment from the biggest climate-polluting companies most responsible for the crisis we’re suffering,” Yu said.,Understanding the impacts of extreme heat and climate change will help save Filipinos in the long run, but governments and authorities need to act soon before it’s too late.,In a mix of Filipino and English, Bagtasa said, “I think the imminent future is scary, if this is going to be the norm. I don’t know what will happen. But it is what it is, we just have to adapt.” –",https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/data-documents/heat-philippines-always-problem-going-to-get-worse/
Ha? Halaman? How to keep your garden alive in this heat,Patricia Kahanap,"May 18, 2024 10:00 AM PHT","MANILA, Philippines – ICYMI: Plants are living things, too, that require tender loving care especially amid excessive heat.,But gardening isn’t for the weak. Melanie Arbias, a faculty member at the University of Santo Tomas Department of Biological Sciences, said that like children or pets, plants require the commitment of their owners to keep them alive.,” she told Rappler. ,“,(The practice of simply replacing plants when they die is not a good practice. If your notion is to buy plants now because you have the money and you can replace them if you can’t take care of them, then don’t take care of plants.),Different plants need different amounts of sunlight to grow and survive. Too much exposure to heat, according to Arbias, could stunt their growth and development.,Owning plants at home has its benefits. Lillian Rodriguez, a faculty member at the University of the Philippines Institute of Biology, said that plants can provide more ventilation at home and help one’s mental well-being, among other things.,“When we see greenery, when we see them around us, it gives us positive feelings and positive emotions; it helps with people’s mental health. Just having even a small potted plant on your desk can help,” she told Rappler.,Here are some tips for , and , on how to keep gardens alive during this warm and dry season.,When starting a garden, you must first consider what plants you want to get.,No two plants are the same – they each need different amounts of water, sunlight, and space to grow. Before planting, you should know what kind of maintenance your preferred plants require and if you are able to consistently provide what they need.,“We cannot protect something we cannot understand,” Arbias said.,” (Know its name, what it looks like, and its field characteristics.),For beginners, Arbias recommended getting low-maintenance plants like philodendrons and succulents, which are more resilient amid extreme heat changing weather conditions. ,Ferns, on the other hand, prefer cooler, shaded areas, according to Arbias.,Rodriguez also encouraged , and ,to ,get plants that are native to the Philippines,. She said that pandakaki and kamuning, for instance, are better suited for the country’s climate compared to most exotic, ornamental plants.,Timing is essential. Although plants can generally survive high temperatures – provided that they are well taken care of – some plants may dry up or struggle to grow because of the heat. ,Should you be interested in getting new plants, Rodriguez said that it may be best to wait until the end of the warm and dry season, ,which usually lasts until May,., she told Rappler. ,“,(, and , should stop planting during the warm and dry season because their plants might die. Imagine the stress of the plant when you place them in a new environment amid the drought.),You must also consider the space your plants will occupy. While it isn’t inherently bad to have exotic species, according to Arbias, carelessly planting them near native ecosystems may do more harm than good for the environment.,When unsure of the proper time and place to have certain plants, Arbias said that new plant owners can always consult landscape architects, horticulturists, or seasoned gardeners.,As a plant owner, it is your responsibility to make sure that your plants receive the appropriate amount of water, sunlight, and nutrients they need to grow and thrive.,Rodriguez and Arbias recommended watering plants two to three times a day, preferably in the early morning or late afternoon., ,‘,” Rodriguez said.,(When you water plants during noontime, the water will dry up very fast. Plants can better absorb water when the sun has barely risen or toward the evening.),Amid El Niño, the environment department encouraged Filipinos to ,avoid activities that consume a lot of water,, like watering lawns and washing vehicles.,To conserve clean water supply at home, Rodriguez and Arbias said that plant owners can use recycled water – or water that has already been used for other household chores – to water their plants.,Some plants also require less sunlight than others. Arbias said that ,and , may want to relocate their plants to a place with more shade if it tends to dry up when exposed to the sun., she said.,(If you consistently water your plants, but the leaves are still dry, you may want to consider moving it to another place. Maybe it doesn’t like full sunlight.),But be very careful when uprooting your plants as you could damage its root hair, which is responsible for absorbing water.,Rodriguez and Arbias also urged , and , to stop buying plants from poachers, or those who sell plants that were illegally taken from their natural habitat.,Native Philippine plants are protected by the ​​,Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act,, which aims to “conserve and protect wildlife species and their habitats to promote ecological balance and enhance biological diversity.” ,How can one identify poachers on the internet? Arbias warned buyers against those selling multiple quantities of native species that seem freshly picked.,she said.,(If you’re a , or , who truly loves plants, even though you really love a certain plant species, don’t buy them if you think the seller is a poacher. You’re condoning the destruction of the natural habitat.),But caring for plants and protecting their natural habitats can only do so much if those in power cannot protect the environment in which they grow.,” Rodriguez said.,(NGOs and private citizens may help a lot, but the government really has a big role because they have more jurisdiction over the lands that we can use.),The environment department in April pledged to ,“significantly increase” the amount of protected areas in the Philippines, by 2030. ,With that, Rodriguez and Arbias urged Filipinos to call on businessmen and government officials to help protect the planet and promote local biodiversity.,” Arbias said.,(I hope that as Filipinos, we would also have a voice. We must protect the ecosystems destroyed by people, no matter what their reason is.) –",https://www.rappler.com/environment/how-take-care-plants-heat/

UP Diliman vendors fear future following clearing operations in Area 2,Rappler.com,"Apr 25, 2024 6:10 PM PHT","QUEZON CITY, Philippines — Things are not so ‘business as usual’ at the famed students’ food strip known as Area 2 in the University of the Philippines Diliman following the recent clearing operation carried out by the Quezon City Department of Public Order and Safety (DPOS) on Tuesday, April 23.,A walk along Area 2 the next day showed students dining and residents going about, with the usual ambiance of idle engines, sizzling plates, and whirring photocopiers.,But ask any resident or vendor about the clearing operation and the mood changes: some express relief that their spaces were left untouched, others were dismayed because of DPOS-confiscated tables, signages, carts—even plants and parking stands—that obstructed gutters or sections of the street.,The operations were conducted in the districts RIPADA (Ricarte, Dagohoy, and Palaris) before moving to Area 1 and 2 in the UP Diliman campus. However, students, residents, and vendors were not informed by officials and were taken by surprise.,said Cheska, a FriedDays employee in Area 2 and a Pook Dagohoy resident, referring to past clearing ops in their area. “,(I didn’t know they were coming here too. They came out of nowhere. That’s why there was commotion yesterday because it was lunchtime, past 12 noon.),A ,video, released by the Diliman chapter of the Union of Journalists of the Philippines showed the DPOS demolishing a concrete partition on the sidewalk with a sledgehammer. Netizens online, many of them UP faculty and students, condemned the act, linking the operation to the recent administration changes and policies within the campus.,*Removed* properties that have been there since I was in undergrad. Andiyan na ang mga stalls na tambayan at core social spaces namin noon. Ang nagbago lang ay dumami ang sasakyang dumadaan sa Area 2 at nagmahal ang mga kainan sa campus. Clearing operations, para kanino? ,https://t.co/KK1qnEkTcG,Later that afternoon, the Philippine Collegian documented ,a snake rally, that was led by organizations and student council members of the UP community to protest the operations.,The Quezon City government ,apologized, in a statement on April 24 for the DPOS mishandling and conduct. The operation was ordered by Barangay U.P. Campus Captain Lawrence Mappala after a request from UP Diliman’s Vice Chancellor for Community Affairs Roehl Jamon. ,While vendors complied with the officials and have since resumed working hours, many remain concerned over the future of their businesses., (This affects us because our spaces are more limited, fewer customers can eat).” said Cheska.,Mark, who mans the MrTakoyakis stand in Area 2, was told by the DPOS that they would revisit the area the following week. He was warned that any recurrence of obstruction violations would result in stall closures.,Deding Palayaw, a vendor at the Kalye Dos stall, was anxious over the warning. “‘, (If we get closed down, we won’t have jobs).”,The clearing operations come under scrutiny after ,increasing commercialization of spaces within the campus, have led many in the UP community to question the administration’s priorities. ,Deding gestured to the direction of the DiliMall’s construction site, the three-floor structure built over the ,burned-down UP Shopping Center,. The new mall is set to open later this year, holding franchised, high-end restaurants and businesses. , (What will happen to us when the DiliMall opens?)”,Roehl Jamon, the Vice Chancellor for Community Affairs of UP Diliman, clarified that the clearing operations he requested were in pursuance of ,QC Ordinance No. SP-2068, S-2011,, and not any issued directive that further commercializes UP spaces.,“There’s no connection to DiliMall, for the record. It is true that at the start of this year, we had several initial meetings with the Barangay UP Campus leadership…it should be a partnership with regards to maintaining peace and order, security, safety, health and sanitation, in UP Campus,” Jamon said.,When asked about the Area 2 operations in relation to the larger issue of commercial interests encroaching upon student and small vendor spaces in the UP community, Jamon clarified again:,“Our office has no authority over commercial spaces or commercial interests inside the campus. That’s another office altogether. For us, it’s really keeping it safe, orderly. The only authority I would probably have would be parking, that’s where I step in. When there’s a robbery, that’s where I step in. The matter you conduct your business is not mine. But if you conduct your business in the middle of the road, it becomes my business.”,However, Jamon acknowledged the “clear lack of coordination” among barangay officials, the DPOS, and his office in carrying out their mandates. “We should have been there when [the clearing operation] started to happen. But we were caught unaware, it was lunchtime. Imagine the surprise and shock of the people,” he said.,Jamon told Rappler he was in between meetings during the operation, while the overseeing barangay captain Mappala was abroad. By that afternoon his office was inundated by calls.,The next morning, representatives from both the student and vendor communities met with Jamon at his office in Quezon Hall to seek clarification and recompense.,“The policy of this office is really protection of everyone,” Jamon said. “If this happens again, they [the community] only need to call us first…If [the barangay and DPOS] have to do another clearing, they have to go through us, and we have to be there in order to protect the interest of the community. I assured them that this is the mandate I gave to all units under this office.”,Vendors are counting on Vice Chancellor Jamon’s commitment to be transparent, as well as in amending and rectifying oversights. Last August, Jamon was under fire for ordering the ,demolition of a guardpost camp, in Quezon Hall, as reported by ,“,Cheska said. “,(The Vice Chancellor should have stated long beforehand what was prohibited to be placed. From the start he should have informed the vendors… The initiative starts with him.),Vendors also appreciated the support of the students and faculty who mobilized to support them during the clearing operation itself, Deding Palayaw’s Kalye Dos stall was spared when dining students quickly cleared and set aside tables and chairs.,The vendors say they are willing to comply with future mandates provided that there are proper communication channels between community and officials, as well as public consultations and assistance.

FACT CHECK: Claim that inhaling intestinal gas can cure disease misrepresents 2014 study,Rappler.com,"May 23, 2024 11:30 AM PHT","Inhaling intestinal gas or farts can help prevent and treat diseases. ,The Facebook reel containing the claim has 9,400 reactions, 537 comments, and 5,8500 shares as of writing. It was uploaded by the page “Kaalamang Herbal,” which posts about herbal medicine and supplements. ,The video implies that inhaling intestinal gas can help prevent and cure diseases. The caption of the video says, ,(Can you inhale intestinal gas as a treatment?)” accompanied by the hashtag #alternativemedicine.,The video, citing unnamed experts, said intestinal gas contains hydrogen sulfide that protects the mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cells. The gas also helps prevent hypertension, heart disease, kidney failure, and Alzheimer’s disease, according to the video. ,Scientists have debunked the claim that inhaling intestinal gas can prevent or cure diseases. According to a ,2014 NBC News article,, misinformation on the supposed health benefits of inhaling intestinal gas stemmed from some news websites’ overgeneralization of a ,press release by the University of Exeter, on its ,2014 study, that highlighted the potential health benefits of hydrogen sulfide.,According to the study, mitochondria use small quantities of hydrogen sulfide when stressed by disease, allowing them to keep working. Scientists then developed a compound called AP39, which helps deliver hydrogen sulfide to the mitochondria. ,“Our results indicate that if stressed cells are treated with AP39, mitochondria are protected and cells stay alive,” Professor Matt Whiteman, one of the researchers, said.,The study added that “preventing or reversing mitochondrial damage is a key strategy” in treating diseases such as stroke, heart failure, diabetes, arthritis, dementia, and aging.,Contrary to the Facebook reel and ,news headlines, that said smelling intestinal gas could prevent disease, neither the researchers nor the study made the claim. ,The University of Exeter press release merely noted that hydrogen sulfide is “well known as a pungent, foul-smelling gas in rotten eggs and flatulence.”,The NBC story also featured Dr. Csaba Szabo of the University of Texas, who collaborated with the University of Exeter researchers.

China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory. Taiwan’s government says only Taiwan’s people can decide their future.,China’s military exercises are part of a sustained pressure campaign against Taiwan stretching back to 2022, said Sklenka, adding that once rare incursions into Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone have now become normal.,However, while President Xi Jinping’s order for China’s military to be prepared for invasion of Taiwan by 2027 needed to be taken seriously, an actual attack was not inevitable or imminent, he said.,“I cannot underscore enough how devastating conflict in the Indo-Pacific region would be,” Sklenka said in the speech to Australia’s National Press Club.,“At stake would be untold numbers of lives, trillions of dollars in global economic damage, and maintenance of an international order that has delivered relative peace and stability over the past 80 years…. And that is why we need to work together to prevent conflict.”,China ramped up military pressure on Taiwan over April and May in the lead up to the inauguration of its new president. Fighter jets staged mock attacks on foreign vessels on foreign vessels while ships and planes encroached close to the island.,Only weeks earlier, China clashed with the Philippines in the contested South China Sea, triggering a diplomatic row and commitments from Japan and the U.S. to deepen security ties with the Philippines.,Sklenka said China repeatedly used its ships to harass and coerce its neighbours in pursuit of, “excessive, illegal and revisionist,” maritime claims and called it an “equal opportunity bully” to its neighbours ringing the sea.,Less than a month after Australia critisised China for an unsafe aerial confrontation over the Yellow Sea, Sklenka said the US military had logged roughly 300 such intercepts since 2021. – Rappler.com",https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/chinese-military-practiced-taiwan-invasion-in-2023/
COA frowns on Albay hospitals’ overcrowding as newly built facilities remain idle,Rappler.com,"May 23, 2024 12:35 PM PHT","MANILA, Philippines – The Commission on Audit (COA) frowned upon the Albay provincial government’s asset management practices as it took notice of four new hospital buildings that remained unused long after the construction projects were completed.,Despite overcrowding in Albay’s public hospitals, the new facilities, which cost more than P198 million, have not been operational and were deteriorating even before they could serve patients, something state auditors blamed on poor planning and mismanagement.,Government auditors blamed the problem on inadequate asset management practices in violation of the Local Government Code.,The unused facilities include the three-level Hospital Building at Ziga Memorial District Hospital (ZMDH) in Tabaco City, which cost P159.5 million. There are three others at the Josefina Belmonte Duran Albay Provincial Hospital (JBDAPH) in Ligao City: the P17.9 million Charity Ward, the P7.9-million Optical and Dental Clinic, and the P12.9-million Health Workers’ Quarters.,The COA noted four other buildings at ZMDH, constructed by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), that are ready for use but have no electricity. These buildings include the ZMDH’s new Infectious Disease Building, Employees’ Quarters, Chief of Hospital’s Quarters, and the hospital morgue.,“In summary, these facilities have been completed for years, but were not utilized immediately because they are not ready for operation. The implementation is taking too long, that the buildings and structures are already depreciating from being idle,” read part of a COA report.,State auditors noted that the Health Workers’ Quarters at JBDAPH was completed on September 3, 2020, while the other buildings were turned over between February and November 2022.,The COA said the new buildings could have been used because the ZMDH and JBDAPH, the largest in Albay province, have been facing serious congestion problems but have continued to admit patients beyond their capacity. –",https://www.rappler.com/nation/luzon/coa-frowns-albay-hospitals-overcrowding-new-facilities-remain-idle/
"Indonesia mulls ban on investigative journalism, LGBT content",Reuters,"May 23, 2024 1:55 PM PHT","JAKARTA, Indonesia – Indonesia’s parliament is proposing changes to its broadcast law that would ban investigative journalism and LGBT content, sparking criticism from civil society groups and filmmakers over restrictions to press freedom and creative expression.,Changes to the 2002 broadcast law were first discussed in 2020 but the details in the latest revisions have spurred concern, with Indonesia’s Press Council saying it would undermine media independence.,“The impact on press freedom is very serious,” said Arif Zulkifli, head of the council’s law and legislation division. “Indonesia’s press law says there must not be any censorship or banning of journalism. So this is contradictory.”,The government is yet to receive the draft bill, communications minister Budi Arie Setiadi told Reuters, adding the revisions must not muzzle media freedom.,The planned curbs on journalism in the world’s third-largest democracy would harm freedom of expression and hard-won liberties since Indonesia emerged from decades of authoritarian rule in 1998, journalism and civil society organizations say.,The bill does not provide details on the proposed ban on investigative reporting and how it might work, but journalist groups were concerned about censorship.,“It will mean that we as journalists will no longer be able to reveal important stories, such as on corruption, nepotism and environmental crimes,” said Bayu Wardhana, head of the association of independent journalists, of the bill.,“If the bill is implemented, there will be no press independence,” the chair of Indonesia’s Press Council, Ninik Rahayu, said, adding that the council had not been consulted during the bill’s drafting process.,The bill has drawn criticism also because it seeks to ban content displaying violence, mysticism, LGBT or “negative behavior or lifestyles that potentially harm the public”.,Prominent filmmaker Joko Anwar slammed the proposal, describing it as “dangerous” and “impossible” to implement.,“The ban on such content not only impedes the creativity of the creative industry, and freedom of the press, but also undermines people’s capacity to filter what they watch,” he said.,Legislators from commission 1, which is overseeing the bill, have stressed the bill’s revisions are in the initial phases and subject to change.,“We don’t want to give the impression that we are homophobic, and monitor excessively,” said Nico Siahaan, a commission 1 member, adding the law would be strongly debated.,Homosexuality is a taboo subject in Indonesia, one of the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nations, where it is illegal in the sharia-ruled Aceh province.,If passed, the changes would apply to all content broadcast in Indonesia, including online streaming platforms.,The Indonesian parliament has been deliberating a series of controversial legal revisions in recent weeks, including changes to the constitutional court law that would allow the government greater power to remove sitting judges. – Rappler.com",https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/indonesia-mulls-ban-investigative-journalism-lgbt-content/

SC penalizes anti-poverty czar Gadon again over gross misconduct,Jairo Bolledo,"May 23, 2024 2:55 PM PHT","MANILA, Philippines – The Supreme Court (SC) again penalized anti-poverty czar ,Larry Gadon, for gross misconduct. ,On Thursday, May 23, the High Court said it found disbarred lawyer Gadon guilty of gross misconduct for committing perjury and making accusations based on hearsay. Sources told Rappler that the SC’s decision was unanimous. ,Gross misconduct is punishable by disbarment, but since Gadon had already been disbarred, “the penalty of disbarment will no longer be imposed but nevertheless recorded in his personal file.” The High Court also fined the official P150,000 and adjudged him ineligible for judicial clemency. ,A disbarred lawyer can seek reinstatement through judicial clemency. But with the SC’s latest decision, Gadon has lost his chance to retrieve his lawyer title.,For lying in his impeachment complaint against former de facto chief justice Maria Lourdes Sereno before the House of Representatives (HOR), a disbarment case was filed against Gadon. Aside from this, he was also accused of filing baseless criminal cases against several SC officials. ,As the body investigating erring lawyers, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines-Committee on Bar Discipline (IBP–CBD) recommended Gadon’s two-year suspension after the panel found the disbarred lawyer lying under oath. Gadon was found to have lied when he claimed that Sereno falsified an SC temporary restraining order (TRO). ,Meanwhile, the IBP body dismissed the cases filed by Gadon against SC officials for lack of evidence. ,When the decision on Gadon’s latest case reached the IBP Board of Governors (BOG), the body modified the penalty to a three-year suspension. The SC adopted the IBP-BOG’s findings, but modified the penalty to gross misconduct punishable by disbarment. ,In explaining its decision, the SC said it found Gadon to have committed perjury for making allegations not based on his personal knowledge or any authentic records in the impeachment complaint he filed. This was contrary to his sworn guarantee in the verification he included in the complaint. ,“Gadon knew that he never had any personal knowledge nor any  authentic document to support the accusation that Sereno falsified a TRO of the Court. Yet, he still included this in his verified impeachment  complaint, attempting to lend a semblance of credibility to his  unfounded accusation,” the SC said. ,“This not only deceived the HOR, but also revealed an intent to inflict unnecessary harm to the reputation of a lawyer and former  member of the Court,” it added. ,According to the SC, these findings proved that Gadon was motivated by malicious intent to malign and defame the former de facto chief justice. ,The SC added that Gadon violated canon II, section 11, of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability, the current code of conduct for lawyers. The said provision prohibits lawyers from making false statements, which can be considered as gross misconduct – a serious offense. ,“His disregard for the verification requirement in impeachment  complaints shows disrespect for the impeachment process, using it to advance his personal agenda rather than air genuine and legitimate  grievances,” the High Court added. ,Even though the 2018 case of Republic vs. Sereno nullified the latter’s chief justice appointment, this did not absolve Gadon in the case, said the SC.,In June 2023, the High Court ,unanimously disbarred, Gadon for his misogynistic and sexist remarks. With a 15-0 vote, the SC moved to disbar him over the viral video where he “repeatedly cursed and uttered profane remarks against journalist Raissa Robles.”  ,In the same decision, the High Court also cited the disbarred lawyer in direct contempt for his allegations of bias and partiality against Senior Associate Justice Marvic Leonen and Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin Caguioa. ,Before his disbarment, Gadon had been previously suspended by the High Court from practicing law “for similarly using offensive and intemperate language, and was warned that a repetition of the same offense will merit a more severe sanction.” He was also suspended by the SC in ,October 2019, for using abusive and offensive language in his professional dealings, and in ,January 2022, in relation to Robles’ case. ,Last year, he was appointed by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. as the government’s anti-poverty czar. – ",https://www.rappler.com/philippines/supreme-court-order-penalizes-gadon-gross-misconduct/

"Who is Chelsea Manalo, Miss Universe Philippines 2024? ",Ysa Abad,"May 23, 2024 11:44 AM PHT","MANILA, Philippines – Chelsea Manalo took home the title of Miss Universe Philippines 2024 during the pageant finals held on Wednesday, May 22, at the Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay. ,The 24-year-old stunner from Bulacan bested 52 other candidates to succeed Miss Universe Philippines 2023 Michelle Dee. ,Growing up, Chelsea recalled being insecure and having poor self-confidence as she experienced bullying because of her skin color and hair. ,In her ,video, she said that it was through her family and friends — whom she calls her “backbone” — that made her realize that she’s “beautiful in [her] own extraordinary way.”,“[Through them] I had a good understanding of accepting my individuality,” she said.,During her preliminary interviews, Chelsea also talked fondly about her mom. “[She] inspired me to believe in myself, that no one will know who you are if you yourself don’t know what you want and aspire to be,” she said. ,Because of her strong support system, she was able to start joining pageants in high school and modeling at the age of 15. ,Since then, Chelsea has become a print, ramp, and commercial model, even working with publishing companies and renowned fashion designers. ,Her first foray into the national pageant scene was in 2017 when she joined the Miss World Philippines competition, where she finished as part of the Top 15. ,“They have supported me in everything I want. They never told me not to chase my dreams,” she said, adding that her parents were “the most supportive” of her when she expressed her desire to join the Miss Universe Philippines 2024 pageant. “They are still with me ever since the beginning.” ,Outside of pageantry, the Filipino-American beauty queen shared that she wanted to be known as an outgoing person. “I think many tend to see me as an introverted person because of how I look physically,” she said. ,She likes going to the beach — describing herself as an “island girl” — and hopes to be able to scuba dive someday. She has “deep passion” for music and dancing and she would love to just “have fun and dance around.” She’s a fur parent to several dogs. ,While the 2024 edition has a loaded lineup of strong contenders, Chelsea managed to be an early standout. ,During the national costume competition, Chelsea wowed pageant fans with her “Mandaragit” ensemble that drew inspiration from endemic flowering trees and exquisite birds found in the country. ,Her pageant stint wasn’t smooth sailing though as she drew backlash with her tourism video for the competition.

In a separate Instagram video, Chelsea also put a spotlight on the rights of overseas Filipino migrant workers as well as the families they left behind. ,During the preliminaries, Chelsea answered that she deserved to be the next Miss Universe Philippines queen because she has the “heart” for it. ,“I have the relatability to be influential to a lot of people with the voice and with the action that I am most passionate about,” she said. “It will open so many opportunities for me so that I can be a change for our nation.” ,While she wasn’t able to top in any of the online challenges and only took home one special award in the preliminaries, Chelsea was able to peak during the coronation night. ,In the ,question and answer portion,, she was asked how she’ll empower others. ,Her winning answer was: “As a woman of color, I’ve always faced challenges in my life. I was told that beauty has standards, but for me, I have listened and always believed in my mother.”,“To always believe in yourself. Uphold the vows that you have in yourself. Because of these, I am already influencing a lot of women who are facing me right now. As a transformational woman, I have 52 other delegates here with me who helped me become the woman I am,” she said. ,Chelsea will represent the Philippines in the Miss Universe pageant to be held in Mexico later this year. A final date has yet to be announced.,She is vying to become the ,fifth Filipina ,to win the Miss Universe title following Gloria Diaz (1969), Margie Moran (1973), Pia Wurtzbach (2015), and Catriona Gray (2018). – ",https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/pageants/bulacan-chelsea-manalo-miss-universe-philippines-2024-things-to-know-profile/

DFA chief: Where’s China’s proof of West Philippine Sea agreements? ,Bea Cupin,"May 23, 2024 11:45 AM PHT","China can claim the existence of bilateral agreements as much as it wants but without proof and without consent from the Philippines, that’s all they are – claims.,“[China] says there are agreements. But where? Show us. I don’t recall ever having discussed proposals to have such agreements,” said Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo on Wednesday, May 22, during a lunch engagement with reporters covering the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA).,Manalo was referring to several agreements that China claims the Philippines agreed to. Beijing also claims that the agreements are binding. ,From decades ago, there’s a supposed promise from Manila to tow the rusting , away from Ayungin Shoal, a feature located just over 100 nautical miles away from mainland Palawan. The Philippines has denied such an agreement. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has said that if the agreement exists, he rescinds it. From the Duterte era, China claims that a “,gentleman’s agreement,” to keep the status quo in the South China Sea – which included not bringing supplies to the rusting ship – was in place.,Then under the current Marcos administration, China claims another agreement – a so-called “new model” (that, at least according to a transcript of a conversation leaked by the Chinese embassy in Manila, meant that the Philippines agrees to terms that seem to favor China’s stakes over the shoal).,Marcos-era officials – from Manalo to chiefs of the security and defense sectors – have denied knowing of the so-called “gentleman’s agreement” and making any new agreements with Beijing. China, through statements from its embassy here and its foreign ministry in Beijing, insists these agreements are valid.,That’s where the Philippines and Beijing… well, disagree.,“It’s not just any agreement. You should have a record of the agreement. And therefore, normally, the common ways to have in writing and to ensure that both sides agree, you sign it. And that’s a record, not an agreement. So if there’s a problem or anything happens, you have something to look back to. You can say ‘you violated the agreement or you did not live up [to it],’ at least you have a basis,” said Manalo.,He added: “China can assert [that] they’re valid, but if we don’t think they’re valid, then it’s not a bilateral agreement. Maybe China thinks it’s an agreement, but it’s not an agreement for us. You normally need two parties to implement an agreement. Why they’re saying it, I don’t know. Maybe it’s to defend what they’re doing. But where’s the proof that we agreed? If there was something in writing, as I said, okay, they might have a case. But there’s none. And they only give their side anyway. So I think we have to take a look at it that way.”,Disagreement over supposed agreements has been an aspect of tensions between the Philippines and China over how to manage the situation in the West Philippine Sea or part of the South China Sea that includes Manila’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ).,Therein lies the most basic disagreement: The Philippines, backed by international law including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 2016 arbitral ruling, considers the 200 nautical miles from its coast its EEZ. In those waters, the Philippines exercises sovereign rights or the ability to “explore, exploit, conserve and manage the living resources” in the area. China, which has rejected the 2016 arbitral ruling, claims a huge chunk of the South China Sea as its own, including the West Philippine Sea.,Under Marcos, the Philippines has become more assertive in enforcing its sovereign rights and making its sovereignty claims in the West Philippine Sea. China has responded by being more aggressive at sea, routinely using water cannons and dangerous maneuvers to stop Philippine missions to features like Ayungin Shoal and Panatag Shoal.,Both chambers of Philippines Congress have launched investigations into the supposed agreements – at the House, the spotlight is on the so-called “gentleman’s agreement,” while in the Senate, legislators are probing the Chinese embassy’s wiretapping of a conversation between then-Western Command chief Vice Admiral Alberto Carlos and China’s defense attaché in Manila.,China, still without bringing out proof, insisted on Wednesday, May 22, that “no one can deny [the] existence] of agreements on the West Philippine Sea. Whether it’s the ‘gentlemen’s agreement,’ or the internal understandings, or the ‘new model’ reached between China and the Philippines on properly managing the situation in the South China Sea, they all have clear timelines and are supported by solid evidence. No one can deny their existence,” said foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin in a press conference.,He also claimed that Carlos’ removal as Wescom chief “is exact evidence that China and the Philippines did reach agreement.”,Carlos confirmed, before a Senate panel that “Colonel Li,” Beijing’s military attaché in Manila, called him up in January 2024. But the Navy general denied making agreements with China. And as Manalo pointed out, where’s the written and signed document?
